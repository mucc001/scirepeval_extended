Those whose hepatic pedicle were occluded continuously for or longer than 30 min during hepatectomy were retrospectively reviewed (continuous HPO group) and compared to the patients whose hepatic pedicle were occluded for the same length of time but intermittently (intermittent HPO group). The amount of intraoperative blood loss, the percentage of the patients who needed blood transfusion and postoperative liver biochemical tests were compared between the two groups.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were 35 cases in continuous HPO group and 38 cases in intermittent HPO group with occlusion time between 30 min and 45 min. The two groups were matched for underlying liver disease ,preoperative liver function, tumor size and location, major intrahepatic vessel involvements and the types and extensions of the hepatectomies. The mean intraoperative blood loss in continuous HPO group was significantly less than that in intermittent HPO group (660 ml vs. 1054 ml, P < 0.05); accordingly, the percentage of patients who need blood transfusion in continuous HPO group was significantly lower than that in intermittent HPO group (48.6% vs. 78.9%, P < 0.01). Patients in both of the groups were recovered smoothly after operation, with no occurrence of liver failure.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe hepatic pedicle can be continuously occluded for 3045 min in cirrhotic patients with well compensated liver function, and when compared to routine intermittent HPO, continuous HPO significantly decreases the intraoperative blood loss and reduces the need for transfusion.

However, accuracy might be dependent on the receptor status of tumors. MRI accuracy for response assessment after homogenous NAC in a relative large group of patients with stage II/III HER2-negative breast cancer has not been reported before.\n\n\nMETHODS\n250 patients from 26 hospitals received NAC (docetaxel, adriamycin and cyclophosphamide) in the context of the NEOZOTAC trial. MRI was done after 3 cycles and post-NAC. Imaging (RECIST 1.1) and pathological (Miller and Payne) responses were recorded. Accuracy measures were calculated and MRI and pathologically assessed tumor sizes were correlated. Tumor size over- and underestimation were quantified.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAccuracy of MRI for determining pathological complete response (pCR) was 76%. The ROC-curve of MRI response and pCR had an area under the curve value of 0.63 (95% C.I. 0.52-0.74). The correlation coefficient of MRI and histopathological tumor measurements was 0.46 (p < 0.001). Correlations were different for ER-positive (r = 0.40, p < 0.001) and ER-negative (r = 0.76, p < 0.001) breast tumors. MRI under- and overestimated the tumor size in 47% and 40% of all patients. In cases of substantial tumor size underestimation (>2 cm), surgical margins were more often tumor positive compared to the rest of the patients (33% vs.12%, p = 0.005).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMRI measurements correlated moderately with tumor size on the surgical specimen. Only in ER-negative breast tumors, MRI tumor sizes correlated sufficiently with residual tumor size on the pathological specimen. Therefore, post-NAC MRI should be interpreted with caution.", "descriptor": "Breast Neoplasms", "qualifier": "pathology"}, {"mag_id": 2065216512, "corpus_id": 18299466, "title": "Quantitative Study of Liver Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Quality at 3T Using Body and Phased Array Coils with Physical Analysis and Clinical Evaluation", "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the quality difference of short echo time (TE) breathhold 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the liver at 3.0T using the body and phased array coils, respectively.

One hundred and one of 112 (90.18%) patients with HCC were CTC positive, even with early-stage disease. CTCs were also detected in 2 of 12 patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV), both of whom had small HCC tumors detected within 5 months. CTC count \u226516 and mesenchymal-CTC (M-CTC) percentage \u22652% prior to resection were significantly associated with early recurrence, multi-intrahepatic recurrence, and lung metastasis. Postoperative CTC monitoring in 10 patients found that most had an increased CTC count and M-CTC percentage before clinically detectable recurrence nodules appeared. Analysis of HCC with high CTC count and high M-CTC percentage identified 67 differentially expressed cancer-related genes involved in cancer-related biological pathways (e.g., cell adhesion and migration, tumor angiogenesis, and apoptosis). One of the identified genes, BCAT1, was significantly upregulated, and knockdown in Hepg2, Hep3B, and Huh7 cells reduced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while promoting apoptosis. A concomitant increase in epithelial marker expression (EpCAM and E-cadherin) and reduced mesenchymal marker expression (vimentin and Twist) suggest that BCAT1 may trigger the EMT process. Overall, CTCs were highly correlated with HCC characteristics, representing a novel marker for early diagnosis and a prognostic factor for early recurrence. BCAT1 overexpression may induce CTC release by triggering EMT and may be an important biomarker of HCC metastasis.Significance: In liver cancer, CTC examination may represent an important \"liquid biopsy\" tool to detect both early disease and recurrent or metastatic disease, providing cues for early intervention or adjuvant therapy.

The cohort included Californians age 15 to 39 years who died between 2000 and 2011 with cancer. Intense end-of-life interventions included readmission, admission to an intensive care unit, intubation in the last month of life, and in-hospital death.

Focusing on the South Indian state of Karnataka, this paper explores a troubling set of local narratives that, we contend, hold broader implications for future programme planning and implementation. Although confronting stigma and discrimination has become a hallmark in community mobilisation discourse, communities of self-identified kothis (feminine men) who were involved in Avahan programme activities continued to articulate highly negative attitudes about their own sexualities in relation to various spheres of social life. Rather than framing an understanding of these narratives in psychological terms of \u2018internalized stigma\u2019, we draw upon medical anthropological approaches to the study of stigma that emphasise how social, cultural and moral processes create stigmatising conditions in the everyday lives of people.

Therefore, we examined the usefulness of zinc as a therapeutic agent for the prevention of ischemic neuronal damage in the brain.

Zn-ATSM2 elicited protective effects against this glutamate- and NMDA-induced neurotoxicity, but did not affect kainite-induced cytotoxicity. In addition, we studied the effects of Zn-ATSM2 on influx of Ca2+, which undergoes modification subsequent to NMDA activation. Zn-ATSM2 significantly decreased glutamate-induced 45Ca2+ uptake.

In the absence of serum, the Na-K pump activity, described as ouabain-sensitive 86Rb uptake (OS), was greater in the VSMC of the SHR than that of the WKY. Addition of serum to the quiescent VSMC stimulated the OS, of which activation was significantly greater with the SHR serum than with the WKY serum. Determination of intracellular Na concentrations in the presence of 1 mM ouabain showed that Na uptake in the absence of serum of the SHR VSMC was greater than that of the WKY VSMC. Subjecting the VSMC to rat serum stimulated Na uptake, which effect was more profound with SHR serum than with WKY serum. A greater stimulation of 5-(N,N-hexamethylene) amiloride(HMA)-sensitive Na uptake by SHR serum accounted for this difference.

Survivin, a member of the family of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), plays key roles in the proliferation and apoptosis of various cell types. Here, we characterized the in vivo function of Survivin in regulating postnatal liver development and homeostasis using mice carrying conditional Survivin alleles. Hepatic perinatal loss of Survivin causes impaired mitosis, increased genome ploidy, and enlarged cell size in postnatal livers, which eventually leads to hepatocyte apoptosis and triggers tissue damage and inflammation.

A 62-year-old man (height 182 cm, weight 92kg) was scheduled for an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. He was diagnosed PD 18 years ago, and underwent bilateral subthalamic nucleus DBS insertion 4 years ago for refractory bradykinesia and tremors. Patient was recently seen in the movement disorder clinic and his DBS was checked to be functioning well. General anesthesia was induced using standard doses of propofol, fentanyl and rocuronium, and maintained with oxygen nitrous oxide and desflurane mixture. Depth of surgical anesthesia was monitored using entropy (Datex-Ohmeda, GE Healthcare, Helsinki, Finland), titrated to values between 40 and 50. The DBS was switched off following induction of anesthesia, and remained off during the whole procedure. To minimize electrical interference, the surgeons used harmonic scalpel exclusively. Intraoperative course was unremarkable. At the end of the surgery, the neuromuscular blockade was reversed. The inhaled anesthetics were stopped, and the end-tidal desflurane concentration was 0.4 volume% (minimum alveolar concentration 0.1). However, entropy values were (response entropy/state entropy) 14/13 and the patient was not awakening. The DBS was switched on at this time. We noticed an instantaneous increase in entropy values from 14/13 to 98/85 (Fig. 1) along with spontaneous eye opening. The patient was extubated within the next few minutes and his postoperative course was uneventful. To our knowledge this is the first report of cortical arousal with subthalamic nucleus stimulation. A previous case report has described a similar phenomenon of cortical arousal during globus pallidus internus stimulation during DBS insertion for dystonia.3 In addition to the transthalamic arousal system, cortical arousal is regulated by an interplay of different subcortical arousal-promoting and sleep-promoting systems involving cholinergic and/or orexinergic neurotransmission. Emergence from anesthesia in patients with PD can be variable depending upon the disease progression, interaction between PD and anesthetic medications. It is recommend that the DBS device be switched off following induction of general anesthesia to prevent electrical injury to the pulse generator as well neural structures in the brain.1,5 Patients with DBS device in situ are a special subset of population where delayed recovery from anesthesia may result if the DBS device is inadvertently left in the \u201coff\u201d position after surgery. We found that there were no clinical or electrical signs of emergence despite using short acting anesthetic agents (propofol and fentanyl), and ensuring adequate elimination of inhaled anesthetics and reversal of neuromuscular blockade.

The minimum criteria for the empiric choice of an antibiotic for acute otitis media are that it should be rapidly bactericidal and reach adequate concentrations in the middle ear fluid. In areas where beta-lactamase-producing strains are prevalent, a beta-lactamase-stable antibiotic should be chosen; good absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and high and consistent penetration into the middle ear are important characteristics.

Exosomal PD-L1 induced immunosuppression microenvironments in cancer patients. However, its prognostic value and immunosuppressive effect in gastric cancer (GC) were poorly understood.MethodsWe retrospectively evaluated the prognostic value of exosomal PD-L1 and soluble PD-L1 in preoperative plasma of 69 GC patients. The correlation between exosomal PD-L1 and the T cell counts or cytokine in the plasma was evaluated in 31 metastatic GC patients before chemotherapy.ResultsOverall survival (OS) was significantly lower in the high exosomal PD-L1 group compared with the low exosomal PD-L1 group (P\u2009=\u20090.004). Exosomal PD-L1 was an independent prognostic factor in GC (n\u2009=\u200969, 95% confidence interval\u2009=\u20091.142\u20137.669, P\u2009=\u20090.026). However, soluble PD-L1 showed no correlation with OS (P\u2009=\u20090.139). Additionally, exosomal PD-L1 in the plasma samples of 31 metastatic GC patients was negatively associated with CD4+ T cell count (P\u2009=\u20090.001, R\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.549), CD8+ T-cell count (P\u2009=\u20090.054, R\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.349), and granzyme B (P\u2009=\u20090.002, R\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.537), indicating that exosomal PD-L1 was associated with immunosuppressive status of GC patients. GC cells also secreted exosomal PD-L1 and were positively associated with the amount of PD-L1 in corresponding GC cell lines. Besides, exosomal PD-L1 significantly decreased T-cell surface CD69 and PD-1 expressions compared with soluble PD-L1 due to its stable and MHC-I expression.ConclusionsOverall, exosomal PD-L1 predicts the worse survival and reflects the immune status in GC patients, resulting from a stronger T-cell dysfunction due to its stable and MHC-I expression.", "descriptor": "Adenocarcinoma", "qualifier": "secondary"}, {"mag_id": 2469200161, "corpus_id": 22869324, "title": "Weight reduction interventions for persons with a chronic illness: findings and factors for consideration.", "abstract": "Obesity in persons with a concomitant chronic illness poses complex issues relating to the choice of appropriate interventions.

Previous studies have suggested increased risk of early menopause (40-45 years) and premature menopause (<40 years) for women with HIV. We aimed to determine age of menopause, prevalence of early menopause and premature menopause, and risk factors for menopause <45 years in Canadian women with HIV.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis was a cross-sectional analysis from the Canadian HIV Women's Sexual and Reproductive Health Cohort Study. Analyses were restricted to biologically female participants reporting being postmenopausal (regardless of etiology). Primary outcome was median age at menopause. Predetermined variables, and those with P\u200a<\u200a0.10 in univariable analyses were considered for inclusion into multivariable logistic regression model, to determine independent correlates of menopause <45 years.\n\n\nRESULTS\n229 women were included. Median age of menopause was 48 years (interquartile range 43, 51); 29.7% of women experienced menopause <45 years: 16.6% with early menopause and 13.1% with premature menopause. In univariable analyses, menopause <45 years was more likely (P\u200a<\u200a0.05) with birth in Canada, white ethnicity, less than high-school education, smoking, recreational drug use, and hepatitis C co-infection. In multivariable modeling, less than high-school education (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22-4.93) and hepatitis C co-infection (aOR 1.90, 95% CI 1.04-3.50) were independently associated with menopause <45 years.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn Canadian women with HIV, median age of menopause was 48 years; 3 years younger than the general population.

Reasons for this variability likely include small or unevenly-distributed samples, different methods for tissue class segmentation and spatial normalization, and the use of different statistical models. Particularly relevant to the latter is the method of adjusting for global (total) gray matter when making inferences about regionally-specific changes. In the current study, we use voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to explore the impact of these methodological choices in assessing age-related changes in gray matter volume in a sample of 420 adults evenly distributed between the ages of 18\u201377 years. At a broad level, we replicate previous findings, showing age-related gray matter decline in nearly all parts of the brain, with particularly rapid decline in inferior regions of frontal cortex (e.g., insula and left inferior frontal gyrus) and the central sulcus. Segmentation was improved by increasing the number of tissue classes and using less age-biased templates, and registration was improved by using a diffeomorphic flow-based algorithm (DARTEL) rather than a \u201cconstrained warp\u201d approach.

Under in vitro conditions, SufA is capable of human fibrinogen hydrolysis leading to inhibition of fibrin network formation, thus suggesting its important role in the development and progression of Finegoldia magna infections. In addition, it has been demonstrated that SufA can hydrolyze antibacterial peptides such as LL-37 and the chemokine MIG/CXCL 9, hence evading host defence mechanisms. Although the SufA protease from F. magna was discovered several years ago, its optimal substrate preference has not yet been identified. Considering the role of SufA, we have focused on the profiling of its substrate sequence preference spanning S1-S3 binding pockets using the FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) approach. Next, based on the structure of the P1 residue of the developed substrate, we narrowed the inhibitor screening to the phosphonic analogues of amino acids containing an arginine-like side chain. Among all the compounds tested, only Cbz-6-AmNphth(P)(OPh)2 showed any inhibitory activity against SufA displaying k2/Ki value of 10,800 M(-1) s(-1). In addition, it prevented SufA-mediated human fibrinogen hydrolysis in vitro and exhibited potent antibacterial activity against F. magna, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli.

Of these patients, 35 underwent revision surgery. Neurologic and surgical outcomes, radiologic findings, surgical procedures, and complications were evaluated. Indications for revision surgery were compared between early (\u226424 months after the first surgery) and delayed (>24 months after the first surgery) revision surgery.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was a higher prevalence of male patients with revision surgery (89%) compared with patients without revision surgery (71.2%, P\u00a0= 0.033).

In this short review, I give three selected examples of new and promising peptide receptor targets. In the somatostatin receptor field, based on in vitro receptor autoradiography experiments showing that much more sst(2) binding sites are detected in tumors using a (177)Lu-labeled sst(2) antagonist than a (177)Lu-labeled agonist, it can be proposed that, in addition to neuroendocrine tumors, nonneuroendocrine tumors with lower sst(2) levels such as breast carcinomas, renal cell carcinomas, and non-Hodgkin lymphomas may become potential candidates for sst(2) antagonist targeting. In the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor field, recent in vitro data show that not only tumor cells may overexpress gastrin-releasing peptide receptors but also neoangiogenic tumoral vessels, making tumors expressing high levels of gastrin-releasing peptide receptors in tumor vessels, such as ovarian or urinary tract cancers, attractive new candidates for gastrin-releasing peptide receptor targeting. In the incretin receptor field, it was found in vitro that, apart from glucagon-like peptide 1 receptors overexpressed in benign insulinomas, incretin receptors, especially the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptors, can be overexpressed in medullary thyroid cancers, an unexpected finding making also these tumors potential novel candidates for incretin receptor targeting.

Hypotension is common and worsens outcome after TBI. Previous studies show that adrenomedullin, a cerebrovasodilator, prevented sex dependent impairment of autoregulation during hypotension after piglet fluid percussion brain injury (FPI). We hypothesized that this concept was generalizable and that administration of another vasodilator, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), may equally improve CBF and cerebral autoregulation in a sex dependent manner after FPI. SNP produced equivalent percent cerebrovasodilation in male and female piglets. Reductions in pial artery diameter, cortical CBF, and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) concomitant with elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) after FPI were greater in male compared to female piglets during normotension which was blunted by SNP. During hypotension, pial artery dilation (PAD) was impaired more in the male than the female after FPI. However, SNP did not improve hypotensive PAD after FPI in females and paradoxically caused vasoconstriction in males. SNP did not prevent reductions in CBF, CPP or autoregulatory index during combined hypotension and FPI in either sex. SNP aggravated ERK MAPK upregulation after FPI.

In metallo-proteins, characterization of the folding pathways becomes even more complex, and therefore, despite their fundamental role in critical biological processes, little is known about their folding and assembly. The study of the mechanisms through which a cofactor influences the protein folding/unfolding reaction has been the rationale of the present study aimed at contributing to the search for cofactors' general roles in protein folding reactions. In particular, we have investigated the folding pathway of two homologous proteins, Ros87, which contains a prokaryotic zinc finger domain, and Ml452-151, lacking the zinc ion. Using a combination of CD, DSC and NMR techniques, we determined the thermodynamics and the structural features, at an atomic level, of the thermal unfolding of Ros87 and compared them to the behavior of Ml452-151. Our results, also corroborated by NMR (1)H/(2)H exchange measurements, show that the presence of the structural Zn(II) in Ros87 implies a switch from the Ml452-151 fully cooperative to a two-step unfolding process in which the intermediate converts to the native state through a downhill barrierless transition.

Cytoplasmic application of either guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) or AlF-4 to stimulate G proteins resulted in a > 4-fold increase in the open probability of the BK channel measured at +40 mV in the presence of a 1 microM concentration of Ca2+. A similar stimulatory regulation was observed after the addition of an activated, mixed Gi/Go alpha preparation. The increase in the open probability during G protein stimulation was associated with a large reduction in the duration of a long closed state of the channel and could be observed in the presence of a protein kinase inhibitor. The half-maximal voltage required for steady state activation of the BK channel decreased from +63 mV to +48 mV in the presence of GTP gamma S. In addition, the half-maximal Ca2+ concentration required for channel opening was reduced from 11.7 microM in control measurements to 1.3 microM during regulation by GTP gamma S. Thus, G proteins increase the open probability of the chromaffin BK Ca(2+)-activated K+ channel by shifting the voltage dependence of channel gating to more negative potentials and by enhancing the affinity of the channel for Ca2+.

The present review summarizes and discusses the main evidence linking the innate immunological response in neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases, thus providing insights into how the responses of innate immunity represent a common denominator between diseases belonging to the neurological and psychiatric sphere. Improved knowledge of such immunological aspects could provide the framework for the future development of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.", "descriptor": "Mental Disorders", "qualifier": "immunology"}, {"mag_id": 2022758533, "corpus_id": 22025234, "title": "HIV-related Eye Disease in Patients Presenting to a Tertiary Care Government Hospital in Turkey", "abstract": "Aim: To document the ocular involvement in HIV-infected individuals in Turkey and to compare the findings with those from other centers throughout the world.

In these applications, accurate construction of biologically meaningful brain network is critical. Sparse learning has been widely used for brain network construction; however, its l1\u2010norm penalty simply penalizes each edge of a brain network equally, without considering the original connectivity strength which is one of the most important inherent linkwise characters. Besides, based on the similarity of the linkwise connectivity, brain network shows prominent group structure (i.e., a set of edges sharing similar attributes). In this article, we propose a novel brain functional network modeling framework with a \u201cconnectivity strength\u2010weighted sparse group constraint.\u201d In particular, the network modeling can be optimized by considering both raw connectivity strength and its group structure, without losing the merit of sparsity. Our proposed method is applied to MCI classification, a challenging task for early AD diagnosis. Experimental results based on the resting\u2010state functional MRI, from 50 MCI patients and 49 healthy controls, show that our proposed method is more effective (i.e., achieving a significantly higher classification accuracy, 84.8%) than other competing methods (e.g., sparse representation, accuracy\u2009=\u200965.6%).

DCs are involved in the innate sensing and modulation of adaptive immunity to pathogens. CD103+ DCs constitute a classical nonlymphoid DC subset that has an important role in generating immunity and maintaining tolerance. Pulmonary CD103+ DCs (CD103+ PDCs), which reside in close association with the airway epithelium, are particularly critical in controlling Tcell immunity against lung infections. In this article, we discuss recent evidence that shines light on the role and mechanism of CD103+ PDCs in modulating CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses against various pathogens, including bacteria and viruses. A deeper understanding of CD103+ PDC function may provide new translational avenues for the development of vaccines and therapeutics against infectious diseases. Mouse CD103+ PDCs are phenotypically characterized by the expression of \u03b1E(CD103)\u03b27, CD11c , CD207, MHC-II, TLR3, XCR1, and Clec9a/DNGR1 but not CD64 and CD11b. The transcription factors Batf3 and Irf8 are critical for the development of CD103+ PDCs, as shown by the lack of these DCs in Batf3or Irf8-deficient mice. Following pulmonary infection, CD103+ PDCs upregulate costimulatory molecules (CD40, CD80, and CD86), produce large quantities of several cytokines (IL-4, IL-13, IL-12, IL-10, IL-23, and IL6), migrate to the lung-draining mediastinal lymph nodes, and prime naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to induce antigen-specific immune responses. Recent studies indicate that CD103+ DCs, along with lymphoid CD8\u03b1+ DCs, form a new class of DCs referred to as type 1 DCs (DC1s), which express the chemokine receptor XCR1 and perform the unique function of cross-presenting exogenous antigens with MHC-I molecules to CD8+ T cells. Owing to similar phenotypic and functional characteristics, human CD141/BDCA-3+ DCs are considered equivalent to murine DC1s. Overall, these DCs constitute a unified DC subset in mice and humans that is developmentally and functionally related. An accumulating wealth of evidence stemming from mouse studies has focused on the function of CD103+ PDCs during viral and bacterial infections. Upon challenge with respiratory influenza A virus or poxvirus infection, mice that lack CD103+ DCs, such as Batf3 and Clec9A\u2212 diphtheria toxin receptor transgenic mice, failed to induce protective immunity, in contrast to control mice, suggesting a protective role for CD103+ PDCs in viral infections. Following influenza A virus infection, CD103+ PDCs acquired and processed apoptotic cell-associated viral antigens in their endocytic compartment, migrated to the mediastinal lymph nodes, and cross-presented the antigens on MHC-I molecules to naive CD8+ T cells to elicit protective virusspecific cytotoxic responses. Interestingly, CD103+ PDCs could cross-present antigens from virally infected cells because of their ability to resist infection by influenza virus via a type I interferonmediated antiviral state. On the other hand, ablation of CD103+ PDCs resulted in decreased production of IFN-\u03b3 by CD8+ T cells and reduced expression of the activation and transcription markers Ki67, CD25, and T-bet in these cells after respiratory vaccinia virus infection. Liang Ng et al. have further shown that CD103+ PDCs not only control cross-priming of CD8+ T cells but also regulate their migration, viability, and memory responses during influenza infection. In doing so, CD103+ PDCs induce upregulated levels of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor, which is important for egress of lymphocytes from the lymph nodes, on activated CD8+ T cells. Moreover, adoptive transfer of bone marrow-derived CD103+ DCs in CD103+ DC-ablated mice promoted the survival of virus-specific effector CD8+ T cells. In addition, CD103+ PDCs purified from the lungs of influenza virus-infected mice expressed an enhanced level of IL-15, which is a critical cytokine for the maintenance of naive and memory T cells. Thus, CD103+ PDCs occupy a central position in regulating various aspects of CD8+ T-cell responses against viral infections. Hemann et al. recently elucidated the immune mechanism that directs CD103+ PDCs to modulate antiviral CD8+ T-cell immunity. Mice lacking the receptor (Ifnlr1) of type III interferon (IFN-\u03bb), which is an immune-modulatory cytokine that has the ability to promote CD8+ T-cell immunity against influenza A virus, showed a significant reduction in migratory CD103+ PDCs, along with CD8\u03b1+ DCs, in the mediastinal lymph nodes after influenza A virus infection. Furthermore, specific deletion of IFN-\u03bb receptor 1 in CD11c+ DCs in a conditional knockout mouse model mirrored the global immune phenotype of Ifnlr1 mice, particularly the diminished CD8+ T-cell responses. Taken together, these findings indicate that IFN-\u03bb signaling has an important role in programming CD103+ PDCs for migration from the lungs to the lymph nodes and induction of an optimal CD8+ T-cell response against influenza A virus. Provided the importance of the CD103+ PDC-IFN-\u03bb-CD8+ T-cell axis in adaptive immunity, it may be prudent to exploit IFN-\u03bb as a vaccine adjuvant against influenza infection. Most information on how CD103+ PDCs control CD4+ T-cell responses comes from studies using bacterial and fungal pathogens.

We previously showed that trastuzumab and chemotherapy induce HER2-specific antibodies which correlate with improved survival in HER2 metastatic breast cancer patients. It remains unclear whether the generation of immunity required trastuzumab and whether endogenous antibody immunity is associated with improved disease-free survival in the adjuvant setting. In this study, we addressed this question by analyzing serum anti-HER2 antibodies from a subset of patients enrolled in the NCCTG trial N9831, which includes an arm (Arm A) in which trastuzumab was not used. Arms B and C received trastuzumab sequentially or concurrently to chemotherapy, respectively.MethodsPre-and post-treatment initiation sera were obtained from 50 women enrolled in N9831. Lambda IgG antibodies (to avoid detection of trastuzumab) to HER2 were measured and compared between arms and with disease-free survival.ResultsPrior to therapy, across all three arms, N9831 patients had similar mean anti-HER2 IgG levels. Following treatment, the mean levels of antibodies increased in the trastuzumab arms but not the chemotherapy-only arm. The proportion of patients who demonstrated antibodies increased by 4% in Arm A and by 43% in the Arms B and C combined (p\u2009=\u20090.003). Cox modeling demonstrated that larger increases in antibodies were associated with improved disease-free survival in all patients (HR\u2009=\u20090.23; p\u2009=\u20090.04).ConclusionsThese results show that the increased endogenous antibody immunity observed in adjuvant patients treated with combination trastuzumab and chemotherapy is clinically significant, in view of its correlation with improved disease-free survival.

The toxin proved effective and selective in vitro andin vivo.

Targeted disruption of the gene has now established that it plays a key role in visceral organogenesis. Embryos homozygous for the mutation died around embryonic day 15 with anemia and severe hypoplasia of the liver and gut. Liver ontogeny commenced normally with formation of the liver diverticulum and differentiation of hepatocytes, but the organ failed to expand and reached only 3% of normal size. The apparent liver hypoplasia was not associated with a notable increase in apoptotic cells. Gut development also began normally, but the intestines failed to undergo extensive elongation and looping and reached only a quarter of normal length. The anemia resulted from a deficiency in the fetal form of hematopoiesis, which occurs in the liver, but no intrinsic defect in Hlx-/- hematopoietic cells was observed in vitro, and liver-derived Hlx-/- hematopoietic stem cells that were transplanted to irradiated normal mice could fully reconstitute hematopoiesis. The impaired fetal hematopoiesis therefore reflects insufficient support function provided by the minute liver. Hlx is normally expressed in visceral mesenchyme lying adjacent to the developing liver and gut epithelia affected by the mutation, but not in the epithelia themselves. Hence, Hlx regulates a mesenchymal-epithelial interaction that drives a vital growth phase in visceral organogenesis. Moreover, because mutation of Hlx blocked liver growth but not its specification, early morphogenesis, or differentiation, development of this organ appears to occur by step-wise inductive interactions under separate genetic control.", "descriptor": "Liver", "qualifier": "embryology"}, {"mag_id": 1998174102, "corpus_id": 19821308, "title": "Induction of ZEB Proteins by Inactivation of RB Protein Is Key Determinant of Mesenchymal Phenotype of Breast Cancer*", "abstract": "Background: Inactivation of RB is a key event for induction of EMT in cancers. Results: ZEB proteins are markedly up-regulated through the reduction of miR-200 family of microRNAs in RB-inactive cancer cells. Conclusion: RB/ZEB pathway plays a pivotal role in mesenchymal and aggressive phenotype in breast cancers. Significance: Suppressing ZEB1 by cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors provides a novel therapeutic strategy for RB-inactive breast cancers. We previously showed that depletion of the retinoblastoma protein (RB) induces down-regulation of the adhesion molecule E-cadherin and thereby triggers the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. To further characterize the effect of RB inactivation on the phenotype of cancer cells, we have now examined RB expression in human breast cancer cell lines and clinical specimens. We found that RB-inactive cells exhibit a mesenchymal-like morphology and are highly invasive. We also found that ZEB proteins, transcriptional repressors of the E-cadherin gene, are markedly up-regulated in these cells in a manner sensitive to the miR-200 family of microRNAs. Moreover, depletion of ZEB in RB-inactive cells suppressed cell invasiveness and proliferation and induced epithelial marker expression. These results implicate ZEB in induction of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, as well as in maintenance of the mesenchymal phenotype in RB-inactive cells. We also developed a screening program for inhibitors of ZEB1 expression and thereby identified several cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors that blocked both ZEB1 expression and RB phosphorylation.

Here we further investigated the mechanism by which spermine inhibits the calcium-induced, cyclosporine A (CSA) -sensitive PTP by using three indicators: 1) calcium release from the mitochondria detected with calcium green, 2) mitochondrial membrane depolarization using TMRM, and 3) mitochondrial swelling by measuring light absorbance. We found that despite calcium release and membrane depolarization, indicative of PTP activation, mitochondria underwent only partial swelling in the presence of spermine. This was in striking contrast to the high-amplitude swelling detected in control mitochondria and in mitochondria treated with the PTP inhibitor CSA. We conclude that spermine selectively prevents opening of the high-conductance state, while allowing activation of the lower conductance state of the PTP.

In this framework, we assessed in a proof of concept study the impact of anatomic and functional imaging modalities acquired prior and during radiotherapy on the target volume delineation and the dose distribution using helical tomotherapy.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nTen patients with pharyngo-laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma were treated by concomitant chemo-radiation delivered in 7 weeks. CT, T2-MRI, fat suppressed T2-MRI, and static and dynamic FDG-PET were acquired for each patient before the start of treatment and during radiotherapy, after mean prescribed doses of 14, 25, 35 and 45 Gy. GTVs were manually delineated on CT and MRI images while PET images were automatically segmented by means of a gradient-based method. From these volumes, CTVs and PTVs were derived using consistent guidelines. Simultaneous integrated boost IMRT planning was performed using helical tomotherapy.\n\n\nRESULTS\nGTVs significantly decreased throughout the course of RT for all imaging modalities (p<0.001). Clinically non-significant differences and high correlations were found between GTVs delineated on CT and MRI, irrespective of the sequence used. By contrast, FDG-PET-based GTVs segmented from pre- and per-treatment images were significantly smaller compared to anatomical imaging modalities, without any difference existing between static and dynamic acquisition. These differences in GTVs translated into parallel reductions of both prophylactic and therapeutic CTVs and PTVs. Resulting FDG-PET-based and adaptive IMRT planning reduced the irradiated volumes by 15-40% compared to pre-treatment CT planning (V(90), V(95) and V(100)), but did marginally impact on doses to the OAR such as the spinal cord and the parotid glands.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAdaptive IMRT with FDG-PET images has a significant impact on the delineation of TVs and on the dose distribution in pharyngo-laryngeal tumors.

In this issue of American Journal of Hypertension, Minami et al.1 investigated the relationship between smoking and blood pressure by evaluating the influence of smoking habits on brachial and central blood pressure and radial augmentation index, a marker of peripheral wave reflection, in a population of Japanese healthy men. Metabolic syndrome incidence according to smoking was also assessed. Augmentation index was found to be higher in current as compared to never smokers and also in current heavy as compared to former smokers. Central systolic blood pressure was lower in never smokers than other groups, while this behavior was less evident for brachial blood pressure. Smoking status was an independent predictor of augmentation index and central systolic blood pressure, but not of peripheral blood pressure. These results might suggest that smoking-associated alteration in wave reflection causes an increased central blood pressure. However, causality for this cannot be concluded upon the cross-sectional design of the study. Furthermore, this hypothesis cannot be completely supported because central arterial stiffness, the other major determinant of central systolic blood pressure,2 was not assessed in this study. Indeed, aortic pulse wave velocity rather than central blood pressure and augmentation index has been suggested to have independent predictive value for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in high risk patients and in the general population.2 It should be also pointed out that differences in peripheral blood pressure varied in parallel with central hemodynamic parameters, although they did not reach statistical significance,1 possibly influencing the changes in central systolic blood pressure and augmentation index.2,3 Another important result of the study is that the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was found to be higher in smokers as compared to subject who never smoked.1 It is well known that heavy smokers have greater incidence of central obesity and lipid changes typical of insulin resistance.4 Augmentation index and central systolic blood pressure were also independently related to waist circumference or body mass index and high-density lipoprotein levels, which therefore can deeply contribute to the incidence of metabolic syndrome in smokers and/or to the effect of central blood pressure and wave reflection.1 Other risky behaviors, such physical activity inactivity or poor diet, which are associated with smoking4 and not investigated in the study, might also influence the findings. Finally, results are not representative of female gender. However, it has been showed that increased augmentation index is selectively impaired in female hypertensive patients in the presence of the metabolic syndrome.3 Despite these limitations, results of the study of Minami et al.1 are of importance for a possible additive pathogenetic mechanism to explain why metabolic syndrome is a major determinant of ischemic cardiovascular disease among middleaged Japanese men and women, in particular among smokers.5 Future intervention studies in large populations would confirm whether smoking cessation reduce cardiovascular risk by reducing central blood pressure, wave reflection, and metabolic syndrome prevalence.", "descriptor": "Hypertension", "qualifier": "etiology"}, {"mag_id": 2043834785, "corpus_id": 31369727, "title": "Nicotinic autoreceptor function in rat brain during maturation and aging: possible differential sensitivity to organophosphorus anticholinesterases.", "abstract": "Acetylcholine (ACh) release is modulated pre-synaptically by both muscarinic and nicotinic receptor-mediated processes. While muscarinic autoreceptors inhibit ACh release, nicotinic autoreceptors enhance ACh release and thus disruption of these processes could potentially affect cholinergic toxicity following exposure to anticholinesterases. Marked age-related differences in sensitivity to some organophosphorus (OP) anticholinesterases have been reported. We compared nicotinic autoreceptor function (NAF) during maturation and aging and evaluated its potential modulation by the common OP insecticide, chlorpyrifos (CPF). Cortical synaptosomes were pre-loaded with [3H]choline, superfused (0.6 ml/min) with physiological buffer and [3H]ACh release was evoked with potassium (KCl, 9 mM), with or without co-addition of exogenous ACh to stimulate nicotinic autoreceptors. Fractions of perfusate were subsequently collected and area under the curve (AUC) for [3H] was analyzed by scintillation counting. The difference in evoked release due to co-addition of exogenous ACh was defined as NAF. Under these conditions, atropine (ATR, 0.1 microM) appeared requisite for NAF; thus this muscarinic antagonist was subsequently added to all perfusion buffers. In synaptosomes from adult tissues, exogenous ACh (3-100 microM) significantly increased release in a concentration-dependent manner. The nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine (MEC, 100 microM) substantially reduced the potassium-evoked release elicited by co-addition of ACh (10 microM). Interestingly, the nicotinic agonists nicotine (NIC) and dimethylphenylpiperazinium (DMPP; 0.1-10 microM) had no effect on release. The active metabolite of CPF (i.e. chlorpyrifos oxon (CPO), 1-10 microM) inhibited NAF in vitro. Maturation-related expression of NAF was noted (AUC with co-addition of 10 microM ACh: 7-day rats, 7+/-6; 21-day rats, 44+/-6; 90-day rats, 196+/-37; 24-month rats, 173+/-52). NAF was substantially reduced (67-91%) 96 h after maximum tolerated dosages of CPF in adult and aged rats (279 mg/kg, sc) but not in juveniles (127 mg/kg, sc), even though AChE inhibition was similar among the age groups (>80%). Together these data suggest that NAF is differentially expressed during maturation and that this neuromodulatory process may be selectively altered by some OP insecticides, potentially contributing to age-related differences in response to AChE inhibitors.

Dopamine content and dopamine receptors have been shown to decrease with age, which may relate to the time of onset of different motor and psychotic disorders, as well as to the appearance of these disorders. For example, some so-called senile movement disorders, such as senile tremor and senile chorea, may relate to alterations in dopaminergic transmission with age, as might the general findings of increased slowing of movements and mildly increased rigidity with age, although it is not clear how common some of these changes are in the medically healthy elderly. Decrease in dopamine with age may also be associated with the findings that choreiform and psychotic disorders (which have been proposed to be related to excess dopaminergic activity) tend to predominate at younger ages, whereas parkinsonism is more common at later ages. Certain findings support this notion, such as the appearance of both dyskinesia and psychosis in patients treated with L-dopa, the finding that psychosis may be less common in patients with later-onset Huntington's disease, and the fact that neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism is often more severe in the elderly. However, the situation is more complicated than this, because there are a number of phenomena that do not fit the pattern, including the observation of an increased incidence of tardive dyskinesia in the elderly. Age-related changes in other transmitters are undoubtedly important in both movements disorders and psychosis, and even dopamine has been proposed to have both trophic and toxic properties over the aging process.

The proportion of patients treated with 5 FDA-approved oral TKI agents-bosutinib, dasatinib, imatinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib-in the 12 months after diagnosis were measured, overall and by year, between 2000 and 2017. We assessed the use of each oral agent through the fourth-line setting. Multivariable logistic regression estimated the odds of receiving any oral agent, adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong 853 patients with CML, 81% received an oral agent between 2000 and 2017. Use of non-oral therapies decreased from 100% in 2000 to 5% in 2005, coinciding with imatinib uptake from 65% in 2001 to 98% in 2005. Approximately 28% of patients switched to a second-line agent, 9% switched to a third-line agent, and 2% switched to a fourth-line agent.

This study aimed to explore the attitudes, motivations, and concerns of both oncology patients and health care professionals (HCPs) regarding biobanking.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nQualitative interviews were conducted with oncology patients and HCPs purposively selected from five Australian hospitals. Patients were invited to give biobanking consent as part of a clinical trial and/or for future research were eligible. HCPs were eligible if involved in consenting patients to biobanking or to donate specimens to clinical trials.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty-two patients participated, with head and neck (36%) and prostate (18%) the most common cancer diagnoses; all had consented to biobanking. Twenty-two HCPs participated, from across eight cancer streams and five disciplines. Themes identified were (a) biobanking is a \"no brainer\"; (b) altruism or scientific enquiry; (c) trust in clinicians, science, and institutions; (d) no consent-just do it; (e) respecting patient choice (\"opt-out\"); (f) respectful timing of the request; (g) need for emotional/family support; (h) context of the biobanking request matters; and (i) factors for biobanking success.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nThese findings reinforced previous findings regarding high public trust in, and support for, biobanking. An initial opt-in consent approach with the option of later opt-out was favored by patients to respect and recognize donor generosity, whereas HCPs preferred an upfront opt-out model. Factors impacting biobanking success included the context of the request for use in a trial or specific research question, pre-existing patient and HCP rapport, a local institution champion, and infrastructure.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE\nPatients and health care professionals (HCPs) who experienced cancer biobanking consent were overwhelmingly supportive of biobanking. The motivations and approaches to seeking consent were largely mirrored between the groups. The findings of this study support the opt-in model of biobanking favored by patients; however, HCPs preferred an opt-out model. Both groups recognize the importance of making the request for biobanking at an appropriate time, preferably with emotional or family support, and respecting the timing of the request and privacy of the patient.

The FT effects were compared with pure MT, which lacked the necessity to filter out irrelevant information. Before and after training, all participants performed an fMRI experiment that included a combined task in which stimuli had to be both filtered based on color and stored in memory. We found that training induced processing changes by biasing either filtering or storage. FT induced larger transfer effects on the untrained cognitive function than MT. FT increased neuronal activity in frontal parts of the neuronal gatekeeper network, which is proposed to hinder irrelevant information from being unnecessarily stored in memory.

This calibration procedure provides a regional measurement of the expected sensitivity of the fMRI BOLD signal to changes in the cellular activity of the brain. Maps of the BOLD signal calibration factor showed regional heterogeneity, indicating that the magnitude of functionally induced changes in the BOLD signal will be dependent on both the local change in blood flow and the local baseline physiology of the cerebral cortex. BOLD signal magnitude is shown to be reduced by 32% from its expected level by the action of oxygen metabolism. The calibrated fMRI technique was applied to stimulation of the human visual cortex with an alternating radial checkerboard pattern.

Subjects were randomly divided into a training set (587) and a validation set (603). ECG prediction models for acute myocardial infarction incorporating different ST elevation criteria and/or additional QRST features (Q waves, ST depression, T wave inversion, bundle branch block, axes deviations, and left ventricular hypertrophy) were developed in training set patients using forward stepwise multiple logistic regression. Models were then prospectively tested in the validation set patients. The optimum ST elevation model (based on > or =1 mm ST elevation in > or = 1 inferior/lateral leads, or > or =2 mm ST elevation in > or =1 anteroseptal leads) correctly classified 83.1% of subjects (55.8% sensitivity, 94. 0% specificity).
