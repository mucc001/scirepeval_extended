Since 1995, despite numerous optimization proposals, sequential pattern mining remains a costly task that often generates too many patterns. This limit, also reached by itemset mining, was circumvented by pattern sampling. Pattern sampling is a non exhaustive method for instantly discovering relevant patterns that ensures a good interactivity while providing strong statistical guarantees due to its random nature. Curiously, such an approach investigated for different kinds of patterns including itemsets and subgraphs has not yet been applied to sequential patterns. In this paper, we propose the first method dedicated to sequential pattern sampling. In addition to address sequential data, the originality of our approach is to introduce a class of interestingness measures relying on the norm of the sequence, named norm based utilities In particular, it enables to add constraints on the norm of sampled patterns to control the length of the drawn patterns and to avoid the pitfall of the \"long tail\" where the rarest patterns flood the user. We propose a new two step random procedure integrating this class of measures, named \\textsc {NUSSampling} NUSS A M P L I N G that randomly draws sequential patterns according to frequency weighted by a norm based utility. We demonstrate that this method performs an exact sampling according to the underlying measure. Moreover, despite the use of rejection sampling, the experimental study shows that \\textsc {NUSSampling} NUSS A M P L I N G remains efficient. We especially focus on the interest of norm constraints and exponential decays that help to draw general patterns of the \"head\" We also illustrate how to benefit from these sampled patterns to instantly build an associative classifier dedicated to sequences.

Seventy adolescents (30 males, 40 females) aged between 12 years, 5 months 18 years, 8 months (M 15 years, 11 months) participated in this research. Participants were allocated by age (younger, n=35, 12 years, 5 months 16 years, 9 months and older, n=35, 16 years, 9 months 18 years, 8 months) into two conditions. There were 34 participants in the first condition: happiness and sadness and 36 participants in the second condition: relaxed and tired. They read a vignette about a protagonist eliciting the condition emotions, then completing a 5 point Likert rating scale, questionnaire and the AES task. Chi Square analysis showed significant results within the questionnaire measure, with older participants reporting more single emotions responses, younger participants identifying AES pattern unknown and only females identifying highly simultaneous patterns of mixed emotions. Chi Square MeNemar found a significant difference between the questionnaire and AES responses in the highly simultaneous mixed emotion patterns. Findings revealed that the questionnaire produced more mixed emotion experience patterns. With some observable differences in the AES responses that were not significant, there is a suggestion in the suitable utility of the AES within the adolescent population. It is suggested that future research investigates adolescents own emotions not just the emotions of a protagonist as well as using an interview measure rather than a questionnaire measure. Emotion understanding and experiencing has been extensively investigated in the last 40 years to understand if conflicting emotions can be experienced simultaneously or sequentially (Bender, Somhovd, Pons, Reinholdt Dunne Esbjorn, 2015; Williams Aaker, 2002) On a daily basis, people find themselves in situations that elicit two different emotions (Watson Tellegen, 1985) with an example being happiness of seeing a sister who lives far away, but also sadness that it is not possible to see her often. With emotions often lacking stability and changing from time to time (Diener Larsen, 1984) it is essential to continue to understand mixed emotion experiences, with the aim to help individuals manage within society and live a fulfilled life. Research investigating children's understanding of emotions has found that emotion understanding is related to the quality of psychological well being, social relationships with peers, adults, and children's ability to resolve cognitive problems alone or in a group (Bender et al. 2015) Mixed emotion research has investigated the understanding in children and adults, but there is a gap in research regarding adolescents and their understanding of emotions in themselves and other people.", "venue": "", "year": 2017.0, "author_names": ["A Student"], "n_citations": 0, "n_key_citations": 0, "score": 0}, {"corpus_id": 230802633, "title": "An international mixed methods study to develop a new preference based measure for women with breast cancer: the BREAST Q Utility module", "abstract": "Background Generic preference based measures (PBM) though commonly used, may not be optimal for use in economic evaluations of breast cancer interventions. No breast cancer specific PBM currently exists, and the generic PBMs fail to capture the unique concerns of women with breast cancer (e.g. body image, appearance, treatment specific adverse effects) Hence, the objective of this study was to develop a breast cancer specific PBM, the BREAST Q Utility module. Methods Women diagnosed with breast cancer (stage 0 4, any treatment) were recruited from two tertiary hospitals in Canada and one in the US. The study followed an exploratory sequential mixed methods approach, whereby semi structured interviews were conducted and at the end of the interview, participants were asked to list their top five health related quality of life (HRQOL) concerns and to rate the importance of each item on the BREAST Q. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded. Constant comparison was used to refine the codes and develop a conceptual framework. Qualitative and quantitative data were triangulated to develop the content of the Utility module that was refined through 2 rounds of cognitive debriefing interviews with women diagnosed with breast cancer and feedback from experts. Results Interviews were conducted with 57 women aged 55 10 years. A conceptual framework was developed from 3948 unique codes specific to breasts, arms, abdomen, and cancer experience. Five top level domains were HRQOL (i.e. physical, psychological, social, and sexual well being) and appearance. Data from the interviews, top 5 HRQOL concerns, and BREAST Q item ratings were used to inform dimensions for inclusion in the Utility module. Feedback from women with breast cancer (N 9) and a multidisciplinary group of experts (N 27) was used to refine the module. The field test version of the HSCS consists of 10 unique dimensions. Each dimension is measured with 1 or 2 candidate items that have 4 5 response levels each. Conclusion The field test version of the BREAST Q Utility module was derived from extensive patient and expert input.

Subjective measures of cough, the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) and Hull Airways Reflux Questionnaire (HARQ) were also administered. Results At baseline the average FeNO value in both high FeNO treatment groups was similar (around 60+ 30 ppb) At the end of the study there was a significant fall in FeNO of approximately 30% in both high FeNO treatment groups (p 0.005) In the low FeNO group there was no significant change during the study (12+ 5 ppb) Therapy reduced the number of coughs in 24 hours by approximately 50% in both low and high FeNO groups (p<0.005) HARQ and LCQ scores also improved significantly (p<0.005) in all treatment groups. Conclusions The hypothesis that FeNO could be used as a marker of eosinophilic inflammation in chronic cough was supported by our observation at baseline in the high FeNO group of eosinophilia in both blood and sputum. However, baseline FeNO did not predict overall treatment response. Perhaps the most surprising aspect of our study is the dramatic response in the low FeNO group to montelukast. The fact that montelukast appears to be equally effective in the low FeNO group suggest the either the current markers of eosinophilic lung disease are insufficiently sensitive to pick up low levels of leukotriene activation in the low FeNO group, or that montelukast has its antitussive activity by an alternative mechanism.

Here, we discover that mimetic color variation in a bumble bee is driven by changes in Hox gene expression. Hox genes are master regulators of numerous segment specific morphologies and thus are some of the most conserved developmental genes across animals. In these bees, the posterior Hox gene Abd B is upregulated in a more anterior location to impart phenotypic change. This homeotic shift happens late in development, when nonspecific effects are minimized, thus availing these genes for color pattern diversification. Similar mimetic color patterns were inferred to use different mutations, suggesting diverse routes to mimicry. Natural phenotypic radiations, with their high diversity and convergence, are well suited for informing how genomic changes translate to natural phenotypic variation. New genomic tools enable discovery in such traditionally nonmodel systems. Here, we characterize the genomic basis of color pattern variation in bumble bees (Hymenoptera, Apidae, Bombus) a group that has undergone extensive convergence of setal color patterns as a result of Mullerian mimicry. In western North America, multiple species converge on local mimicry patterns through parallel shifts of midabdominal segments from red to black. Using genome wide association, we establish that a cis regulatory locus between the abdominal fate determining Hox genes, abd A and Abd B, controls the red black color switch in a western species, Bombus melanopygus. Gene expression analysis reveals distinct shifts in Abd B aligned with the duration of setal pigmentation at the pupal adult transition. This results in atypical anterior Abd B expression, a late developmental homeotic shift. Changing expression of Hox genes can have widespread effects, given their important role across segmental phenotypes; however, the late timing reduces this pleiotropy, making Hox genes suitable targets. Analysis of this locus across mimics and relatives reveals that other species follow independent genetic routes to obtain the same phenotypes.", "venue": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": 2019.0, "author_names": ["Li Tian", "Sarthok Rasique Rahman", "Briana D Ezray", "Luca Franzini", "James P Strange", "Patrick Lhomme", "Heather M Hines"], "n_citations": 24, "n_key_citations": 0, "score": 1}, {"corpus_id": 182107603, "title": "Faculty Opinions recommendation of A homeotic shift late in development drives mimetic color variation in a bumble bee.", "abstract": "", "venue": "Faculty Opinions Post Publication Peer Review of the Biomedical Literature", "year": 2019.0, "author_names": ["Stacey D Smith"], "n_citations": 0, "n_key_citations": 0, "score": 0}, {"corpus_id": 202024363, "title": "Faculty Opinions recommendation of A homeotic shift late in development drives mimetic color variation in a bumble bee.", "abstract": "", "venue": "Faculty Opinions Post Publication Peer Review of the Biomedical Literature", "year": 2019.0, "author_names": ["Xin Zhou", "Shiqi Luo"], "n_citations": 0, "n_key_citations": 0, "score": 0}, {"corpus_id": 207809077, "title": "Historical changes in bumble bee body size and range shift of declining species", "abstract": "Bumble bees are declining worldwide, their vital ecosystem services are diminishing and underlying mechanisms are species specific and multifaceted.

Whereas B. pascuorum queens probably colonize all the potential nesting sites in an area, invaded by I. glandulifera or not, the abundance of polyphenol ampelopsin in pollen from I. glandulifera pollen might reduce local parasite prevalence.

I also showed that selenate exposure altered the composition of the bumble bee microbiome and that the growth of two major gut symbionts Snodgrassella alvi and Lactobacillus bombicola was unaffected by this exposure. Due to the pervasiveness of environmental pollution in bee habitats, I exposed bumble bees to cadmium, copper, selenate, imidacloprid, and hydrogen peroxide and found that each of these compounds can be lethal to bees. I also showed that most of these chemicals can affect the diversity of the bee microbiome and that there is interstrain variation in toxicant tolerance genes in the major bee symbionts Snodgrassella alvi and Gilliamella apicola. As exposure to cadmium or selenate has been shown to affect animal associated microbes, I assayed the effects of these chemicals on honey bees and observed shifts in the bee microbiome at multiple timepoints. I also found that exposure to selenate and cadmium changes the overall bee metabolome and may cause oxidative damage to proteins and lipids. Lastly, I found that bee associated bacteria can bioaccumulate cadmium but generally not selenate. In this dissertation I demonstrated that bee associated bacteria are generally robust to toxicant exposure, but that chemicals can alter the composition of both bumble bee and honey bee microbiomes. I also show that toxicants affect bee metabolism, and that the bee microbiome plays an important role in maintaining host health when challenged with toxicants.", "venue": "", "year": 2019.0, "author_names": ["Jason A Rothman"], "n_citations": 1, "n_key_citations": 0, "score": 0}, {"corpus_id": 147705094, "title": "Infection outcomes are robust to thermal variability in a bumble bee host parasite system.", "abstract": "Climate change related increases in thermal variability and rapid temperature shifts will affect organisms in multiple ways, including imposing physiological stress.

In the context of host parasite interactions, the beneficial acclimation hypothesis posits that shifts away from acclimation or optimum performance temperatures will impose physiological stress on hosts and will affect their ability to resist parasite infection. We investigated the beneficial acclimation hypothesis in a bumble bee trypanosome parasite system. Freshly emerged adult worker bumble bees, Bombus impatiens, were acclimated to 21 degC, 26 degC or 29 degC. They were subsequently experimentally exposed to the parasite, Crithidia bombi, and placed in a performance temperature that was the same as the acclimation temperature (constant) or one of the other temperatures (mismatched) Prevalence of parasite transmission was checked four and six days post parasite exposure, and infection intensity in the gut was quantified at eight days post exposure. Parasite strain, host colony, and host size had significant effects on transmission prevalence and infection load. However, neither transmission nor infection intensity were significantly different between constant and mismatched thermal regimes. Furthermore, acclimation temperature, performance temperature, and the interaction of acclimation and performance temperatures had no significant effects on infection outcomes. These results, counter to predictions of the beneficial acclimation hypothesis, suggest that infection outcomes in this host parasite system are robust to thermal variation within typically experienced ranges.

They need to be able to warm themselves quickly to ensure mobility and retain that heat to improve efficiency, but sometimes need to facilitate heat loss to avoid overheating. Thermal biology becomes especially important during the intermittent flights required for foraging. As soon as a bee lands on a flower it begins cooling to a point that will make it unable to fly. To continue flying between flowers bees will have to maintain an elevated body temperature while feeding or rewarm themselves after feeding.

LDCs have surprisingly many applications in computer science and mathematics (we refer to [13, 10] for extensive surveys) But despite their ubiquity, they are poorly understood. Of particular interest is the tradeoff between the codeword length N as a function of message length k when the query complexity the number of probed codeword symbols and alphabet size are constant. The Hadamard code is a 2 query LDC of length N 2O(k) and this length is optimal in the 2 query regime [11] For q 3, near exponential gaps persist between the best known upper and lower bounds. The family of Reed Muller codes, which generalize the Hadamard code, were for a long time the best known examples, giving q query LDCs of length exp(O(k1/(q 1) until breakthrough constructions of matching vector LDCs of Yekhanin and Efremenko [12, 6] In contrast with other combinatorial objects such as expander graphs, the probabilistic method has so far not been successfully used to beat the best explicit LDC constructions. In [3] a probabilistic framework was given that could in principle yield best possible LDCs, albeit non constructively. A special instance of this framework connects LDCs with a probabilistic version of Szemeredi's theorem. The setup for this is as follows: For a finite abelian group G of size N |G| let D G be a random subset where each element is present with probability r independently of all others. For k 3 and e (0, 1) let E be the event that every subset A G of size |A| e|G| contains a proper k term arithmetic progression with common difference in D. For fixed e 0 and sufficiently large N it is an open problem to determine the smallest value of r denoted rk such that Pr[E] 1 2 In [3] it is shown that there exist k query LDCs of message length O(rkN) and codeword length O(N) As such, Szemeredi's theorem with random differences, in particular lower bounds on rk, can be used to show the existence of LDCs. Conversely, this connection indirectly implies the best known upper bounds on rk for all k 3 [8, 4] However, a conjecture from [9] states that over ZN we have rk Ok(N logN) for all k, which would be best possible. Truth of this conjecture would imply that over this group, Szemeredi's theorem with random differences cannot give LDCs better than the Hadamard code. For finite fields, Altman [1] showed that this is false. In particular, over Fp for p odd, he proved that r3 O(p n n2) generally, rk O(p n nk 1) holds when p k 1 [2] In turn, these bounds are conjectured to be optimal for the finite field setting, which would imply that over finite fields, Szemeredi's theorem with random differences cannot give LDCs better than Reed Muller codes. The finite field conjecture is motivated mainly by the possibility that so called dual functions can be approximated well by polynomial phases, functions of the form e2piP (x)/p where P is a multivariate polynomial over Fp. We show that this is false. Using Yekhanin's matching vector code construction, we give dual functions of order k over Fp that cannot be approximated in L distance by polynomial phases of degree k 1.

Hashing aims to learn short binary codes for compact storage and efficient semantic retrieval. We propose an unsupervised deep hashing layer called Bi half Net that maximizes entropy of the binary codes. Entropy is maximal when both possible values of the bit are uniformly (half half) distributed. To maximize bit entropy, we do not add a term to the loss function as this is difficult to optimize and tune. Instead, we design a new parameter free network layer to explicitly force continuous image features to approximate the optimal half half bit distribution. This layer is shown to minimize a penalized term of the Wasserstein distance between the learned continuous image features and the optimal half half bit distribution. Experimental results on the image datasets Flickr25k, Nus wide, Cifar 10, Mscoco, Mnist and the video datasets Ucf 101 and Hmdb 51 show that our approach leads to compact codes and compares favorably to the current stateof the art. Introduction Semantically similar images or videos can be found by comparing their output features in the last layer of a deep network. Such features are typically around 1,000 continuous floating point values (He et al. 2016) which is already too slow and large for moderately sized datasets of a few million samples. Speed and storage are greatly improved by replacing the continuous features with just a small number of bits. Unsupervised hashing aims to learn compact binary codes that preserves semantic similarity without making use of any annotated label supervision and is thus of great practical importance for indexing huge visual collections. In this paper, as illustrated in Fig. 1, we see the transition from a continuous variable to a discrete binary variable as a lossy communication channel. The capacity of a hash bit as measured by the entropy is maximized when it is half half distributed: Half of the images are encoded with 1 and the other half of the images is encoded with +1. We minimize the information loss in the hash channel by forcing the continuous variable to be half half distributed.

Through bioinformatics analysis, we surmised that LINC01410/miR 23c/CHD7 may play a role through the formation of competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) mechanism. CHD7 expression was positively regulated by LINC01410, and inversely controlled by miR 23c. Furthermore, the promoting effects of miR 23c inhibitor or CHD7 upregulation on EC cell growth and aggressiveness were attenuated by LINC01410 silencing.

The study was conducted in the Hamilton, Halton, and Credit Valley regions of Ontario, Canada, in which the existing Ontario Provincial Groundwater Monitoring Network was augmented with additional monitoring wells. The Dual Entropy Multiobjective Optimization (DEMO) model was used in these analyses. The value of using this design objective is rooted in the information contained within the estimated recharge. Recharge requires knowledge of climate, geomorphology, and geology of the area, thus using this objective function can help account for these physical characteristics. Two sources of groundwater recharge data were examined and compared, the first was calculated using the Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) and the second was an aggregation of recharge found using both the PRMS and Hydrological Simulation Program Fortran (HSP F) The entropy functions are used to identify optimal trade offs between the maximum information content and the minimum shared information between the monitoring wells. The recharge objective will help to quantify hydrological characteristics of the vadose zone, and thus provide more information to the optimization algorithm. Results show that by including recharge as a design objective, the spatial coverage of the monitoring network can be improved.

Typical methods for capturing such data include observations, focus groups, and interviews. Yet little consideration has been given to how such methods create interactions between researchers and study participants, which may affect participants' engagement, and thus implementation activities and study outcomes. In the context of a clinical trial, we assessed whether and how ongoing telephone check ins to collect data about implementation activities impacted the quality of collected data, and participants' engagement in study activities. Researchers conducted regular phone check ins with clinic staff serving as implementers in an implementation study. Approximately 1 year into this trial, 19 of these study implementers were queried about the impact of these calls on study engagement and implementation activities. The two researchers who collected implementation process data through phone check ins with the study implementers were also interviewed about their perceptions of the impact of the check ins. Study implementers' assessment of the check ins' impact fell into three categories: (1) the check ins had no effect on implementation activities, (2) the check ins served as a reminder about study participation (without relating a clear impact on implementation activities) and (3) the check ins caused changes in implementation activities. The researchers similarly perceived that the phone check ins served as reminders and encouraged some implementers' engagement in implementation activities; their ongoing nature also created personal connections with study implementers that may have impacted implementation activities. Among some study implementers, anticipation of the check in calls also improved their ability to recount implementation activities and positively affected quality of the data collected. These results illustrate the potential impact of qualitative data collection on implementation activities during implementation science trials. Mitigating such effects may prove challenging, but acknowledging these consequences or even embracing them, perhaps by designing data collection methods as implementation strategies could enhance scientific rigor.

It also recommends that government and relevant stakeholders should collaborate with financial institutions to ensure that funds are readily available to farmers to enable them to effectively adapt to climate change as well as provide training/workshop programs to farmers to enhance their capacity in planning and implementing effective strategies to climate change.,This study used the integrated methodological approach where quantitative methods were combined with appropriate qualitative methods. According to Sandelowski (2000) this method ensures reliability (the extents to which results are consistent over time) and validity (the means of which measurements are accurate) of the research. A combination of participatory methods, including key informant interviews, household questionnaire surveys and focus group discussions were used, allowing local people the opportunity to participate by sharing their experiences and knowledge to outline possible solutions to the problem at hand. Multiple methods (Yeasmin and Rahman, 2012) are good at reducing the inadequacies of a single method. Cross sectional study was used in designing the research. Variables were measured or determined at the same period in a given population. This method allowed the assessment of practices, attitudes, knowledge and beliefs of a population in relation to a particular event or phenomenon (Olsen and George, 2014),The findings of this study revealed farming as the major occupation in the two communities with males being dominant. Diverse livelihood activities such as fishing, animal/poultry rearing, firewood/charcoal production, hunting and driving were other activities respondents engaged to earn a living. In terms of institutional arrangements, avoidance of bush burning and tree felling were the norms influencing decision making in the two communities. Fear of being punished, animals feeding on some of the grasses, trees inducing rainfall as well as benefits respondents get from trees were the reasons these norms were adhered to in the study area. Access to land, gender dynamics and finance were identified as the socioeconomic factors in the study area. High demands by landowners, last minute change of mind by landowners, limited fertile lands, lack of money to acquire lands, behavior of tenants, number of acres required and lands far from water bodies were the challenges associated with acquiring land in the communities. Access to finance influenced respondents' ability to acquire fertile lands, lands closer to water bodies and any number of acres of their choice. Gender however impeded women adaptation strategies to climate change. Women were not allowed to own land and other property in the form of animals simply because they are seen as migrants and they do not know the history of the land.,This is a master's thesis project.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 18 second and 26 third PMMs with two palatal roots (2PR) were examined from the collection of extracted teeth. The reference sample of 44 extracted PMMs with one palatal root was selected such that pairs of morphologically matching PMMs with one and 2PR were formed. The external morphology of these tooth pairs was examined under a stereomicroscope and distinguishing traits were registered. The Fisher's exact test was applied to examine differences between second and third PMMs. Additionally, the external morphology of 17 PMM with 2PR in 15 patients was analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS Extracted PMMs with 2PR possessed the following distinguishing morphological traits: crown wider on the palatal half (55.3% double Carabelli cusps (23.7% pronounced palatal indentation of the crown (20.5% thick palatal enamel extension (16.3% palato radicular groove (11.6% and palatal enamel pearl (2.3% Differences between second and third PMMs were not statistically significant (P .05) At least one distinguishing trait was present on 63.4% and 94.1% of extracted and clinically evaluated PMMs with 2PR, respectively.

Acknowledgment of intraspecific variation is an important part of a reliable species diagnosis. For mammalian taxonomy, tooth morphology is an especially important trait and, therefore, the morphological variability of these structures is also greatly significant. Here we describe major dental variation present for Protolipterna ellipsodontoides Cifelli (Litopterna) based on a sample of more than 500 teeth and provide a differential diagnosis distinguishing the species from its sister taxa. Initially, the sample was carefully observed under stereomicroscope in order to identify variable traits. Further variable features were also highlighted by a geometric morphometric analysis. We conducted statistic tests to assess the likelihood that the fossils belong to a single species and the single identity of the sample was recovered. A great deal of our results show that structures like the parastyle, hypocone, conular cristae and ectoflexus can show different degrees of development for the same species. The tooth outline may also show some variation in shape and proportions. Many of those features are used as characters of phylogenies, however, the results obtained indicate these traits to be inappropriate for this sort of study, as they are variable within a single species. Some accessory cusps were also found, but they have very low frequency. Furthermore, these traits lack a clear phylogenetic signal and hence are of dubious validity to taxonomy and systematics.", "venue": "Ameghiniana", "year": 2019.0, "author_names": ["Tabata Zanesco", "Lilian P Bergqvist", "Agatha Agnes Pereira"], "n_citations": 1, "n_key_citations": 1, "score": 0}, {"corpus_id": 213801783, "title": "Analysis of Metric and Morphological Dental Traits in Relatives", "abstract": "Background: Teeth can provide evidence about the nature and extent of variation among populations.

Methodology: 82 adult individuals were grouped according to relation and according to gender. Twenty six dental morphological traits were scored from prepared dental casts of all individuals. Dental metric data were recorded for 14 bucco lingual crown dimensions and mesio distal dimensions. Results: The study showed high frequency of tuberculum dentale, carabelli's cusp and four cusped mandibular second molars. Dental traits with low frequency included winging, interruption groove, congenital absence of incisors, four cusped mandibular first molars, and six cusped mandibular first molars.

Kata Kunci: keterampilanspeaking, permainan \"word chain\" teksdeskriptif Abstract For many years, speaking activity in English class has been dominated by teachers. The students lack opportunities to practise their speaking skill. This condition makes mastering speaking ability is more difficult to them and teachers could not fulfill the aims of teaching speaking. One of the aims of teaching speaking and may be the final target of it is to enable students to speak the language naturally (Kayi: 2006) In this study, the researcher uses the modified word chain game, which is commonly used to improve students' vocabulary, to teach descriptive speaking. This study uses descriptive qualitative research method, because it aims to describe and to explain a natural phenomenon: what is happening? why is it happening? and how is it happening? (Chariri, 2009:9) The writer focuses on the application of the word chain game to teach descriptive speaking and the students' responses toward it. In the data analysis, the writer describes the data gained from an observation, how the teacher applied the technique, how the students participated, and how the students' responses were. The result shows that the word chain game is applicable in speaking class where the material is descriptive text. The writer found that game does not require much preparation, does not need any instrument or media, and its rules are easy to understand. It encourages students to participate actively in the class, to speak the target language more, and makes the students enjoy the lesson.

Seedling tolerance to water stress is vital for better crop development through the entire period under drought stress condition. The enhancement of plant stress tolerance due to melatonin application is already known; however, the specific underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. The current study was done to investigate the effect of melatonin priming on rapeseed germination and subsequent seedling growth under PEG 6000 simulated drought stress. Drought stress significantly inhibited germination and seedling growth, led to oxidative stress from excessive H2O2 generation, and reduced the chlorophyll content. Melatonin priming alleviated the oxidative damage and the amount of chlorophyll reduction in rapeseed seedlings under the drought stress.

Our attack exploits the characteristics of DNN based ASR systems, where we extend the original analysis procedure by an additional backpropagation step. We use this backpropagation to learn the degrees of freedom for the adversarial perturbation of the input signal, i.e. we apply a psychoacoustic model and manipulate the acoustic signal below the thresholds of human perception. To further minimize the perceptibility of the perturbations, we use forced alignment to find the best fitting temporal alignment between the original audio sample and the malicious target transcription. These extensions allow us to embed an arbitrary audio input with a malicious voice command that is then transcribed by the ASR system, with the audio signal remaining barely distinguishable from the original signal.

However, water is a limited resource and should be used as efficiently as possible, which requires appropriate management. As such, the search for irrigation techniques that are more efficient in terms of water use, such as subsurface drip irrigation, is ongoing. Subsurface drip irrigation systems are highly efficient and can serve as suitable alternatives for the rational management of water. However, these systems also have limitations; specifically, variation in flow rate can occur depending on the soil characteristics. Subsurface drip irrigation systems covered by only a thin soil layer have been used, especially in irrigated coffee crops in Brazil; however, most related studies have investigated the variation in the flow rate at relatively great soil depths. Thus, the objective of the present study was to evaluate two emitters buried at a depth of 5 cm to determine the variation in the flow rate within four different soil types, and assess the wet bulb. The evaluated soil types were classified as a sandy loam, silty loam, clay loam or clay, and the two emitters evaluated included a pressure compensating drip emitter (PC) and a non pressure compensating model (NPC) With respect to the PC emitter, a flow rate reduction was detected only in the clay loam soil, but with respect to the NPC emitter, a reduction in the flow rate was detected in a sandy loam and clay loam. The flow rate varied even at shallow depths for some soils, and the soil type and emitter flow rate affected this variation, as well as the water distribution in the wet bulb. Thus, this variation should be considered even for systems installed at shallow depths.", "venue": "", "year": 2021.0, "author_names": ["Virgilio Henrique Barros Nogueira", "Adriano Valentim Diotto", "Michael Silveira Thebaldi", "Alberto Colombo", "Yasmin Fernandes Silva", "Elvis Marcio de Castro Lima", "Gabriel Felipe Lima Resende"], "n_citations": 2, "n_key_citations": 0, "score": 0}, {"corpus_id": 223618420, "title": "Irrigation Water Use Efficiency and Yield of Pistachio under Aerated Subsurface Drip Irrigation System", "abstract": "Improving yield and Irrigation Water Use Efficiency (IWUE) is important for pistachio cultivation in Iran.

The focus of this work was to evaluate aerated water irrigation (oxygation) under SDI to overcome hypoxia in saline loam silt soil environments on 15 years old pistachio trees in desert climate. Two treatments including F3 (irrigation frequency once every 3 days without air injection) and F3 oxygation (irrigation frequency once every 3 days by air injection) were investigated in two years. The injection of 18% by volume air into irrigation water by SDI resulted in a beneficial effect on yield and IWUE in the second year of experiment; with yield values of 4.9 ton ha for F3 oxygation against 4.4 ton ha 1 for F3; and IWUE values of 4.2 kg ha 1 mm for F3 oxygation against 3.7 kg ha 1 mm for F3. Decreases in yield and IWUE in the F3 oxygation in comparison with F3 were 33.3 and 28.2% in the first year, respectively; but yield and IWUE due to F3 oxygation were 11.1 and 13.5% greater in the second year compared to F3, respectively.

The rising level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and its consequent effect on the global climatic conditions, the depletion of stratospheric ozone, acid rain, and photochemical smog are some of the issues that have been addressed by scientists and policy makers the world over. Solutions to most environmental problems can be obtained only through collective efforts and, to ensure that such efforts are effective, it is necessary that policies and legislation are made based on scientific data on our ever changing environment. The data must provide information on the nature of trace constituents present in the different layers of the atmosphere, their concentrations, and their chemistry. A variety of experimental techniques have been used for this purpose, such as fluorescence spectroscopy, infrared (IR) and ultraviolet/visible (UV/VIS) absorption, Raman scattering, and photoacoustic spectroscopy. All these techniques exhibit some combination of the following features: multielement detection, low detection limits (DLs) specificity for an unequivocal identification of species, accuracy, and precision. One of the experimental techniques that has found important applications in the study of the atmosphere is matrix isolation (MI) spectroscopy. In this technique, the molecules of interest are diluted in a large excess of an inert gas and sprayed onto a cold substrate held at 10 K. Under these conditions, the molecules are trapped, isolated from each other and only surrounded by inert gas atoms. Such cold, isolated molecules yield spectra that have narrow spectral widths. Furthermore, if the trapped species are reactive molecules or radicals, they are likely to have extended lifetimes in the inert cage, thus allowing their chemistry and spectroscopy to be studied at leisure. These features of MI have made it particularly useful in the study of atmospheric chemistry. The high resolution capability enables one to use this technique as an analytical tool, as closely lying spectral features of different molecules can now be resolved a feature that has been employed to identify and estimate trace constituents in the upper tropospheric and stratospheric samples. In conjunction with gas chromatography (GC) MI and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) referred to as GC/MI/FTIR, offers a powerful tool with which to resolve isomeric forms of environmentally hazardous chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) dioxins, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) Such isomeric resolution is essential, as it is well known that only certain isomeric forms are biologically active, whereas the others are not. In this respect, GC/MI/FTIR even scores over GC mass spectroscopy (MS) Analytical spectroscopy of matrix isolated species is also done using fluorescence spectroscopy, where again the advantage of high resolution enables one to resolve isomeric forms of compounds. Where the species of interest is a free radical, electron spin resonance (ESR) is the technique of choice to study the trapped species. This is a particularly powerful tool, as free radicals are known to play an important role in a number of atmospheric processes. Another aspect of MI spectroscopy is its ability to study reaction intermediates, a feature that has been employed to study the reaction mechanisms of atmospherically important chemical and photochemical reactions. All these aspects of the technique are discussed in this article, using examples.", "venue": "", "year": 2006.0, "author_names": ["K S Viswanathan", "K Sankaran", "K Sundararajan"], "n_citations": 5, "n_key_citations": 0, "score": 0}, {"corpus_id": 100205822, "title": "Heterogeneous processing of {sup 13}NO{sub 2} at zero concentration by monodisperse carbon aerosols", "abstract": "The heterogeneous chemical processing of atmospheric cases by both natural and anthropogenic aerosols plays a key role in the regional as well as global environment.

Global Warming and Climate Change 2 Introduction As human activities continue to add greenhouse gase s carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxides to the Earth's atmosphere, global te mp ratures are expected to rise, causing the Earth's climates to change. These climate changes may affect precipitation patterns, severe and extreme weather events, and over time environmental systems. Furthermore, human health and agriculture may be sensitive to climate change. Th e Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has concluded that global warming is inevita ble and that human activity is likely to be the main cause. The National Research Council's Grand Challenges in Environmental Sciences (NRC, 2000) identified eight \"grand challenges,\" fo ur f which are directly linked to climate and climate change. Thus, it is vital that students le arn about global warming and climate change. Teaching about global warming and climate change is essential for developing well rounded students, and for overcoming a critical def iciency in atmospheric science and climatology curricula (Serafin et al. 1991) Furth ermore, teaching about global warming and climate change provides a natural context for study ing science through personal and social applications. An understanding that is essential i f future citizens are to assume responsibility for the management and policymaking decisions facing ou r planet (Brown, 1992; Bybee, 1993) Therefore, if science education is to promote a cit izenry that is knowledgeable about global warming and climate change it is essential to deter mine what students' conceptions are about global warming and climate change (Osborne Freybe rg, 1985) in order to plan curriculum and design instruction that builds on students' concept ions (Driver et al. 1994) The purpose of this study was to investigate sevent h grade students' conceptions about global warming and climate change, add to the extan t literature base on students' geoscience and environmental science learning, and provide guidanc e to curricular development. We selected Global Warming and Climate Change 3 seventh grade as this is the grade level at which s tudents begin to learn about global climate, weather, and related phenomena (e.g. hydrologic cy cle) developing an understanding of the Earth as a system the interrelationship among the p hysical, chemical, and biological processes that shape and change the Earth (NRC, 1996) Speci fically, the research question guiding this study was: What are seventh grade students' concep tions of global warming and climate change? Based on these findings we make curricular recommen dations that build on students' conceptions and the National Research Council (NRC) science education standards (NRC, 1996) Furthermore our study expands on past resea rch, providing a historical perspective on students' conceptions as well as providing new insi ght into students' conceptions about the potential environmental impact of global warming an d climate change. Background We reviewed 14 international studies published betw e n 1993 and 2005 that investigated secondary students' conceptions of global warming a nd climate change. Because of the limited number of studies that specifically investigated se venth grade students' conceptions of global warming and climate change; we expanded our literat ure review to secondary students, grades 612. Instead of individually describing each of the studies, we report our interpretation and categorization of the findings in tabular form (Tab les 1 4) We grouped the findings from these studies into four themes and 20 categories. The fo ur themes are: conceptions about global warming, the greenhouse effect (Table 1) causes of global warming and climate change (Table 2) environmental impact of global warming and clim ate change (Table 3) and resolutions (Table 4) Within each theme we identified categor ies that reflect the students' conceptions. For each category we identify specific findings that ma ke up the category along with the authors. Global Warming and Climate Change 4 Table 1.

This paper argues that systems analysis and modelling of environmental systems is one necessary part in successful governing of societies towards sustainability. In the 1960th many observations and data made it evident that the environment in most countries was in a bad state. To get a holistic view of the complex problems and to clarify the relationships of structure and function, systems thinking was applied e.g. modelling, cybernetics, systems analysis, life cycle assessment and energy and material flow analysis. Such tools used collectively, conceptualized as 'integrated assessment' can help to communicate fundamental knowledge, and to support decision making when identifying, developing and implementing precautionary measures and solutions. There are good examples demonstrating the strength of such approaches; Solutions to the ozone depletion by replacing CFC's with more chemically reactive compounds that are degraded within the troposphere. Acidification of European low buffer soils and lakes, sensitive to acid rain, has decreased due to concerted action on Sulphur emission control in large parts of Europe. The handling and recycling of solid waste has resulted in a considerable reduction of deposits in large parts of the world. This basically natural scientific knowledge has also influenced the development within e.g. economy and jurisprudence and today ecological economy and environmental law assume ecological systems as fundamental. The complexity of ecosystems and environmental issues can only be understood by use of advanced scientific tools such as modelling as a base for establishing interdisciplinary co operation. Each component of such models will of course be an approximation, but validation and verification of the models will serve to make them useful. An ongoing research project at Mid Sweden University aims at building a complete carbon and energy balance model of an entire Swedish region, based on the Danish Samso model. Such models will make it possible to refer to a robust scientific base, thereby making it easier to argue for appropriate measures and actions. At the same time it will be clear what data these actions rest upon thereby making it easier to identify possible errors or limitations. Systems analysis and subsequent modes are constructs. According to systems theory and model development they are strategies as the best representations of nature, we can make. At the same time it must be assured, that a continuous adaptation and improvement in a studied area is possible i.e. that model outcomes are matched with phenomenological observations and that empirical work also is carried out. Model development can therefore be characterized as a dynamic and iterative process. Governance in the Anthropocene must be based on an understanding of the problem picture at hand, and learning how to appropriately address increasingly complex issues. For identifying potential solutions and consequences of policy implementation, systems modelling on relevant levels will be one necessary tool. The current project developing an environmental regional model, illustrates how modelling can provide decision support for the county of Jamtland regarding management of energy resources and planning of future infrastructure, as well as serving regional and national information purposes.", "venue": "", "year": 2015.0, "author_names": ["Torbjorn Skytt", "Soren Nors Nielsen", "Erik Gronlund", "Fredrik Stahl", "Anders Jonsson", "Inga Carlman", "Morgan Froling"], "n_citations": 1, "n_key_citations": 0, "score": 0}]}

Programmable pumps may be used for continuous subcutaneous hydrocortisone infusion (CSHI) with modulated rates that mimic the circadian rhythm of serum cortisol concentrations [2] We report the use of CSHI in a woman with secondary adrenal insufficiency (SAI) and multiple allergic reactions, including to excipients of the standard oral hydrocortisone tablet. A 42 year old woman (body weight: 64 kg, BMI: 22.2 kg/m, body surface area (BSA) 1.75 m) with secondary hypothyroidism and SAI from idiopathic ACTH deficiency (basal serum cortisol: 42 nmol/L, plasmatic ACTH: 1.83 pmol/L) was admitted to our Endocrine Unit because of profound asthenia, inability to cope with daily activities, hypotension, and nausea and vomiting in the morning. She was suffering from allergic reactions to several drugs, perfumes, cosmetics, solvents, and paints with previous episodes of anaphylaxis. The oral administration of a 10 mg hydrocortisone tablet had previously induced an anaphylactic reaction with severe hypotension and laryngeal angio oedema, which required hospitalization and adrenalin treatment. At the time of admission, substitutive therapy was 25 mg/day of a hydrocortisone preparation containing biologic rice amid, in four daily administrations. Our CSHI protocol was approved by the local ethics committee (CEAS Regione Umbria, 3049/17) The Italian Health Ministry approved the use of a Medtronic MiniMedTM 640G (Medtronic MiniMed, 18000 Devonshire Street, Northridge, CA, USA) insulin infusion pump for CSHI in our patient (DGFDM.VI/P/I.5.i.n/2017/367) Written informed consent was obtained. We chose a hydrocortisone preparation containing only sodium phosphate as excipient (Flebocortid(r) 500 mg/5 mL) The ampoule and the infusion kit were changed every 3 days. We initially set the infusion program according to available data in the literature (2) with a total daily hydrocortisone dose slightly lower than that used with the oral preparation. 7.00 am serum cortisol concentration ranged from 295 to 345 nmol/L in the first 3 days after CSHI was started and 24 h free urine cortisol was within the normal range (712 nmol/24 h) Subsequently, within the first 2 weeks, we gradually reduced the total daily dose of hydrocortisone (from the initial dose of 21.625 mg/day, 12.4 mg/m BSA to 18.7 mg/day, 10.7 mg/m BSA) and programmed a more gradual increase of cortisol infusion between 2.00 and 7.00 am, because of referred sleep disturbances. During the following months, the patient experienced improvement of well being with CSHI, with resolution of nausea and vomiting at wakening. She was also able to restart many of her home work and daily physical activities (including sport activities) that had been stopped after diagnosis of SAI. During 14 months of follow up, she did not refer adverse reactions nor addisonian crisis, and all blood and urine values remained unchanged and within the normal range (including blood glucose, electrolytes, kidney/ liver parameters, total cholesterol, high density lypoproteins (HDL) low density lypoproteins (LDL) and triglycerides) An adrenal insufficiency specific quality of life questionnaire (AddiQoL 30) (score from 30 to 120) [3] scored 57 at baseline, 73 at 6 months, and 78 at 12 months CSHI.

At present, reproductive problems, both in women and men, are quite widespread in the world. According to the WHO data there are about 80 million couples in the world who have some difficulties in conception, carrying and giving birth to children. The reproductive health impairment is becoming one of the main problems of modern society, and consequently, the number of psychological problems also increases, because the inability to conceive or carry a baby safely, provided that there is a conscious desire to have children, is one of the most difficult life situations.Method:The leading method to investigate this problem is diagnostic and static methods that allow us to identify the presence of specific features in self perception and emotional state of a woman during her pregnancy, focusing specifically on the psychological characteristics of women with pregnancy pathologies.Results:Based on the results of the empirical research, the hypothesis put forward about the presence of the specific features in self perception and anxiety levels of pregnant women without pathologies and women with pathology of pregnancy was confirmed. Women with pregnancy pathology are less likely to feel self confidence, they have lowered self acceptance, but compared to women without pathology of pregnancy, the subjects often blame themselves for the situation that happened, they start to be responsive to their health and react to any bodily changes.Conclusion:Psychological support and guidance of pregnant women at maternity welfare centers (level I) should focus on the formation of personal and social perception of the concepts \"I am pregnant\" and \"My child\" at antenatal clinics of maternity hospitals (II level) to focus on the formation of rational ideas about the emerged pathology of pregnancy.", "venue": "", "year": 2018.0, "author_names": ["Nigina S Babieva", "Natalia V Sidyacheva", "Sophia A Mudrak", "Igor V Kalinin", "Eugene V Zolotkova", "Valentina Vasilevna Buyanova", "Irina V Mikhailova"], "n_citations": 5, "n_key_citations": 0, "score": 0}]}

Methods: The study included 62 patients with TLE (64% male) aged 8 to 16 years (M=12.62; SD=2.26) who underwent comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation. Results: Correlation analyses revealed significant association between patient depression and WCST Total Perseverations, BRIEF Behavioral Regulation Index (BRI) and family stress. Perseverative errors on the WCST and the BRI were found to significantly predict depression features in youth with TLE. Patient performance on WCST was also found to fully mediate the significant relationship between hippocampal sclerosis (HS) and depression in pediatric TLE. Finally, logistic regression indicated HS in the presence of TLE was associated with a four fold risk of clinically significant depression ratings. Conclusions: The current findings offer strong support for the relationship between executive function (EF) and depression in pediatric TLE.

The impact of maternal depression has led to recommendations on systematic perinatal depression screening. Unfortunately, large scale initiatives on PD screening have found no benefit unless systems are in place to facilitate appropriate interventions for women who screen positive. Pediatric primary care has been a focus of efforts to support screening and management of PD because pediatric providers, unlike adult healthcare providers, have the most frequent contact with postpartum women through well child visits. Well child visits thus present an unparalleled opportunity to detect and intervene with PD. Literature reviews suggest that specific strategies are feasible within pediatric settings and could benefit both the woman and her child. In this article, we present a stepped care approach for screening and managing PD, integrating common elements found in existing pediatric based models. A stepped care approach is ideal because PD is a heterogeneous condition, with a range of presentations and hence responsiveness to various interventions. This care pathway begins with systematic screening for depression symptoms, followed by a systematic risk assessment for women who screen positive and care management based on risk profiles and responsiveness. This approach allows pediatric providers to be optimally flexible and responsive in addressing the majority of women with PD within the context of the family centered medical home to improve child well being.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that pediatricians identify women with maternal depression. The authors examined trends in inquiring about (asking informal questions) or screening for (using a standardized instrument) maternal depression by pediatricians in 2004 and 2013 and identified correlates of usually inquiring/screening to identify maternal depression. Methods: Data were ascertained from 778 nontrainee pediatricians exclusively practicing general pediatrics who completed the 2004 (n 457) and 2013 (n 321) AAP Periodic Surveys. Pediatricians answered questions about physician and practice characteristics, training, attitudes, and inquiring/screening to identify maternal depression. Sample weights were used to reduce nonresponse bias. Weighted descriptive and logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results: The prevalence of usually inquiring/screening to identify maternal depression increased from 33% to 44% (p .01) In both years, pediatricians who usually inquired about child/adolescent depression had increased odds of usually inquiring/screening to identify maternal depression. Patient race/ethnicity and training in adult Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) diagnostic criteria for depression were associated with inquiring/screening in 2004, and believing that family screening is within the scope of the pediatrician was associated with inquiring/screening in 2013. Conclusion: Although inquiring/screening about maternal depression has increased since 2004, less than half of pediatricians usually screen or inquire about maternal depression, representing a missed opportunity to identify depression and manage or refer women for treatment.

Exposure to multiple traumatic events is associated with a wide range of adverse health and social outcomes in children. OBJECTIVE To examine the association of probable maternal depression, PTSD, and comorbid PTSD and depression with the risk for child maltreatment and parenting stress and with the number of traumatic events to which preschool children are exposed. DESIGN Cross sectional observational design. We used analysis of variance to determine whether probable maternal psychopathology groups differed on child maltreatment, parenting stress, and children's exposure to traumatic events. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to examine the unique and interactive effects of depression and PTSD severity scores on these outcomes. SETTING Urban pediatric primary care outpatient clinic. PARTICIPANTS Ninety seven mothers of children aged 3 to 5 years. EXPOSURE Pediatric primary care visit. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Probable maternal depression and/or PTSD, parenting stress, child exposure to traumatic events, and child maltreatment. RESULTS Mothers with probable comorbid PTSD and depression reported greater child directed psychological aggression and physical assault and greater parenting stress. The children of mothers with PTSD (mean number of events the child was exposed to, 5.0) or with comorbid PTSD and depression (3.5 events) experienced more traumatic events than those of mothers with depression (1.2 events) or neither disorder (1.4 events) Severity of depressive symptoms uniquely predicted physical assault and neglect. Symptom scores for PTSD and depression interacted to predict psychological aggression and child exposure to traumatic events. When PTSD symptom severity scores were high, psychological aggression and the number of traumatic events children experienced rose. Depressive symptom severity scores predicted the risk for psychological aggression and exposure to traumatic events only when PTSD symptom severity scores were low. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Children of mothers with PTSD are exposed to more traumatic events. Posttraumatic stress disorder is associated with an increased risk for child maltreatment beyond that associated with depression.

The potential presence of a species is determined by the combination of abiotic conditions and the biota already present. However, biota also alter their environment, with the emergence of a high oxygen concentration in the atmosphere being one of the most important biotic driven changes of abiotic conditions in history. Plants play an important role in ecosystems, because they are the primary producers and they strongly control nutrient cycles, especially those of N and P. A large part of the available N and P in the ecosystem is organically bound in plants, as organisms have a high demand of N and P to produce various components, like proteins, energy carriers, genetic material and phospholipids. These nutrients may be returned to the soil through exudation, leaching or turnover of dead material. A strategy to minimise nutrient losses through litter is to resorb these nutrients during tissue senescence, thus producing litter with low nutrient concentrations. Moreover, the slow turnover rate of litter with low nutritional value slows down nutrient cycling, and thus leads to a positive feedback between plant species dominance and nutrient availability (Chapin 1993, Aerts 1999) Plant growth in natural terrestrial ecosystems is mostly N limited, although P limitation also occurs frequently (Chapin 1980) Therefore, resorption of N and P from senescing tissue is of great adaptive significance, because the resorbed nutrients are directly available for further use (e.g. seed filling, bud growth, storage) making a species less dependent on current nutrient uptake (Aerts and Chapin 2000) In spring, remobilisation of nutrients from storage organs can lead to (competitive) early regrowth of foliage, even before the start of nutrient uptake from the soil (Thornton and Millard 1993, Millard", "venue": "", "year": 2004.0, "author_names": ["Luisa M Van Heerwaarden"], "n_citations": 4, "n_key_citations": 0, "score": 0}, {"corpus_id": 4995957, "title": "Nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations and allocation strategies among shrub organs: the effects of plant growth forms and nitrogen fixation types", "abstract": "AimsWe aimed to explore the influences of plant functional groups on nutrient concentrations and allocation strategies among shrub organs, as well as to examine the effects of climate, soil and species on nutrient concentrations in shrubs of different plant functional groups.MethodsWe investigated the nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations in roots, stems and leaves and their influencing factors of 187 shrub species in the shrublands across southern China, and we also examined the relationships between N and P among various organs using scaling analysis.ResultsThe scaling relationships of N and P tended to be allometric between leaf and non leaf organs, while they tended to be isometric among non leaf organs. Plant functional groups affected nutrient allocation among shrub organs, where a higher proportion of nutrients were present in the stems and roots of evergreen shrubs and non legume shrubs when compared to deciduous shrubs and legume shrubs as nutrients within a plant increased. Among organs, N and P concentrations were higher in leaves than in stems and roots. Among functional groups, evergreen shrubs and legume shrubs were more P limited than deciduous shrubs and non legume shrubs, respectively.

Element stoichiometry considers the balance between different nutrients and how this balance is affected by the environment. So far, focus of plant stoichiometry has mainly been on the three elements carbon (C) nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) but many additional elements are essential for proper plant growth. Our overall aim is to test the scaling relations of various additional elements (K, Ca, Mg, S, Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn) by using ten data sets from a range of plant functional types and environmental conditions. To simultaneously handle more than one element, we define a stoichiometric niche volume as the volume of an abstract multidimensional shape in n dimensions, with the n sides of this shape defined by the plant properties in question, here their element concentrations. Thus, a stoichiometric niche volume is here defined as the product of element concentrations. The volumes of N and P (VNP) are used as the basis, and we investigate how the volume of other elements (VOth) scales with respect to VNP, with the intention to explore if the concentrations of other elements increase faster (scaling exponent 1) or slower <1) than the concentrations of N and P. For example, scaling exponents >1 suggest that favorable conditions for plant growth, i.e. environments rich in N and P, may require proportionally higher uptake of other essential elements than poor conditions. We show that the scaling exponent is rather insensitive to environmental conditions or plant species, and ranges from 0.900 to 2.479 (average 1.58) in nine out of ten data sets. For single elements, Mg has the smallest scaling exponent (0.031) and Mn the largest (2.147) Comparison between laboratory determined stoichiometric relations and field observations suggest that element uptake in field conditions often exceeds the minimal physiological requirements. The results provide evidence for the view that the scaling relations previously reported for N and P can be extended to other elements; and that N and P are the driving elements in plant stoichiometric relations.

Significant economic resources are being devoted to new research and incentives for broad deployment of renewable energy technologies. The U.S. Department of Energy released a report in 2008 in which the agency began to assess the feasibility of meeting a goal of 20% U.S. electricity provided by wind by 2030 (DOE 2008) The Obama Administration has publicized somewhat different goals, that is, to generate 10 percent of U.S. electricity from all renewable sources in 2012 and 25 percent in 2025 (see http:/www.whitehouse.gov/agenda/energy and environment/ Environmental risk issues are prominent in the challenges for meeting any of these goals (DOE 2008) Adverse ecological effects of some wind energy projects include bird and bat fatalities from collisions with wind turbines and potential decrements in abundance of wildlife through displacement by wind farms. These issues are in the spotlight because of the visible and local nature of the collisions and the direct pathway from the stressor to the \"receptor\" or endpoint. It is hard to ignore a situation where exposure is equivalent to mortality, whether that mortality comes from physical contact with a turbine blade or from the sudden drop in air pressure near the turbine blade. In contrast, downstream impacts of coal usage are generally less newsworthy. Environmental assessments conducted for wind developers or related regulatory purposes currently use inconsistent methods, with some assessments adopting more rigorous analysis and robust metrics than others, and with some attributes of birds or bats more adequately supported by monitoring and off site information than others. Some completed assessments are publicly available as examples, but other assessments and supporting data are held back for proprietary reasons. Many environmental assessments could be improved if they used the formal process of an ecological risk assessment framework that emphasizes problem formulation, a quantitative characterization of exposure, a quantitative characterization of effects, and a risk characterization that involves weight of evidence or a probabilistic endpoint. The use of risk assessment for siting wind energy projects has been advocated by the state of New York (e .g Chautauqua Windpower et al. 2004) The large scale deployment of wind energy has important implications for the field of ecological risk assessment.

However, the causal chain between low frequency noise and health effects still remains unclear.

The stimulating process is different from the hearing process in the cochlea, which implies that the A weighting is not appropriate for evaluating the risk of low frequency noise and that an alternative method is required. In this study, we developed a frequency weighting for low frequency noise based on existing physiological evidences of the vestibular system and a psychological experiment on vibration and/or pressure perceptions. The obtained frequency weighting showed steep peak around 40 80Hz, which was distinctly different from A weighting. We also derived the dose response relationship between the weighted sound pressure level and the perception of vibration and/or pressure which may be caused in the vestibular system.

Using PayPlace, consumers establish a virtual unidirectional payment channel with an intermediary operator to pay for their transactions. Unlike state channels, however, the PayPlace operator can reference the custodial funds accrued off chain in these channels to in turn make tamper proof off chain payments to merchants, without locking up corresponding capital in channels with merchants. Our design ensures that new payments made to merchants are guaranteed to be safe once notarized and provably mitigates well known drawbacks in previous constructions like the data availability attack and ensures that neither consumers nor merchants need to be online to ensure continued safety of their notarized funds. We show that the on chain monetary and computational costs for PayPlace is O(1) in the number of payment transactions processed, and is near constant in other parameters in most scenarios.

The volume CT dose index (CTDI vol) and dose length product (DLP) were recorded in all patients and the effective dose was calculated. For the assessment of image quality, attenuation was measured as Hounsfield units (HUs) within various regions of interest (ROIs) These ROIs were used to calculate the signal to noise ratio (SNR) and contrast to noise ratio (CNR) Subjective image quality was assessed using a five point Likert scale. On 4D cCT, the ejection fraction of both ventricles (RVEF, LVEF) as well as the ratio of RVEF and LVEF (RVEF/LVEF) was assessed. The statistical difference of all parameters between the PE and non PE group was calculated. RESULTS The mean effective radiation dose was 4.22 2.05 mSv. Attenuation measurements on CTPA showed the highest attenuation values in the main pulmonary artery (442.01 187.64) On 4D cCT attenuation values were highest in the descending aorta (560.59 208.81) The CNR and SNR values on CTPA were highest within the main pulmonary artery (CNR 12.43 4.57; SNR 15.14 4.90) On 4D cCT images, the highest SNR and CNR could be measured in the descending aorta (CNR 10.26 5.57; SNR 10.86 5.17) The mean LVEF was 60.73 14.65 and the mean RVEF was 44.90 9.54 The mean RVEF/LVEF was 0.79 0.29.

CONCLUSION The investigated combined CTPA and 4D cCT protocol is feasible using a single contrast bolus and allows the evaluation of RV function in patients with suspected PE. Further studies have to evaluate the additional value of this protocol regarding risk stratification in patients with PE. KEY POINTS High pitch CTPA is fast enough to leave sufficient contrast material within the heart that can be used for an additional low dose functional cardiac CT examination. The tube current of the evaluated 4D cCT is reduced over the entire cardiac cycle without any full dose peak. Low dose cardiac CT subsequently performed after high pitch CTPA allows for detailed analysis of RV function. CITATION FORMAT Schafer JC, Haubenreisser H, Meyer M et al.

Test bolus required another 15 ml CM to determine time to peak enhancement of the contrast bolus within the pulmonary trunk. Attenuation profiles in the pulmonary trunk and on segmental level as well as in the ascending aorta were measured to evaluate the timing techniques. Additionally, overall image quality was evaluated. RESULTS In all patients an adequate and homogeneous contrast enhancement of more than 250 HU was achieved in the pulmonary arteries.

The United States and Brazil are the main producers of ethanol, which account for 58% and 27% of total production, respectively. Ethanol has been known as a leading biofuel and as an additive to gasoline. In the USA, ethanol was produced from corn, from sugarcane in Brazil, and grains in Europe. The price of corn, sugarcane, grains and crude oil (gasoline) have a direct impact on the price of ethanol. The most common purification technique utilized in the ethanol industry is rectification followed by azeotropic distillation. This method is energy consume and its separation capacity is inadequate. Pervaporation system with inorganic membrane has been proposed as a new method for ethanol purification. The main objective of this research is to produce and characterize the performance of inorganic membrane made from a zeolite geopolymer for pervaporation of ethanol water separation. Zeolite was produced through geopolymerisation route using laterite as raw material. The aluminous iron type of laterite was dehydroxylated at 750 degC for 4 h to enhance its reactivity in a high alkali environment. The elemental compositions of laterite were examined by using x ray fluorescence (XRF) The structure, phase and chemical compositions of zeolite geopolymer were measured by using the x ray diffraction (XRD) technique. The microstructure of the resulting membrane was investigated by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) Liquid N2 absorption based on the Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) method was used to determine the pore size distribution of the zeolite geopolymer membrane. The pervaporation experiment was performed by using two membranes having different compositions (designated as K1 and K2) at temperature 50 degC and 70 degC. The measurement results showed that there are two types of zeolites produced namely sodalite and sodium silicate hexahydrate. The crystalline level of both zeolites is very high and regular in shape based on SEM examination. BET measurements showed that the pore size of K1 ranging from 15 to 900 A and K2 ranging from 15 to 2000 A. The results of pervaporation experiments showed that the selectivity of both membranes was very low due to high permeation flux.

This is particularly true for South Africa, which is still grappling with inequalities and pressure for social redress in its universities. Early responses to supporting students took the form of add on, 'deficit model' approaches which understood poor student retention and success rates as emerging from students' lack of neutral literacy 'skills' Recent initiatives have begun to adopt more socio cultural understandings of literacy that seek to challenge traditional power structures and cultivate horizontal peer orientated spaces for learning with a focus on practice rather than on product. Writing groups, as spaces for academic writing development, embrace this orientation and are argued to provide a transformative framework that foregrounds proactive student learning and experience, while still accommodating disciplinary learning through peer engagement. Drawing on the successful implementation of such forms of support at a research intensive university, this paper argues that writing groups can play a critical role in both personal (student) transformation and broader curriculum transformation. Data include anonymous questionnaires and surveys with participants and coordinators of the writing groups. An inductive, constant comparative analysis indicated that students feel empowered in this space to develop not only their writing practices but also their transforming identities as scholars. Writing groups were found to provide 'safe spaces' where academic practices can be made explicit and where they can be challenged. The paper therefore argues that writing groups can play a small but key role in broader transformation efforts.", "venue": "", "year": 2018.0, "author_names": ["Kirstin Wilmot", "Sioux McKenna"], "n_citations": 12, "n_key_citations": 2, "score": 0}, {"corpus_id": 150180178, "title": "The mismatch between first year students' expectations and experience alongside university access and success: a South African University case study", "abstract": "The widening of access into higher education institutions in South Africa has rapidly transformed the student population to become more diverse. Students vary in age, race, culture, backgrounds, educational experiences, academic potential and university expectations. Widening university access with the commensurate need for success requires intervention mechanisms to ensure university management addresses student challenges, especially at first year undergraduate level. Access and success cannot be achieved without understanding students' university expectations and experiences, as these are critical factors that are integrated with retention and success. This paper examines the gap between students' expectation and experience and argues that the intensity of such a gap can negatively impact the goal of achieving access and success amongst students from diverse backgrounds. The study utilised a pre and post survey to collect quantitative data from 95 first year teacher education students at a university of technology in South Africa. The results indicate that there is a significant gap between students' expectations and their actual university experience with regard to the following indicators: social engagement, academic engagement and seeking academic support. It is posited that such a mismatch between students' university expectations and experience can result in students feeling disconnected to the institution, which could lead to academic failure and high drop out rates. This study recommends that an intentionally planned first year experience programme is required to entrench a more inclusive and sustainable first year experience for 'all students' which could close the gap between students' expectation and experience and access and success.", "venue": "", "year": 2018.0, "author_names": ["Subethra Pather", "Nirmala Dorasamy"], "n_citations": 4, "n_key_citations": 1, "score": 0}, {"corpus_id": 214815489, "title": "University Teaching as a Profession:A Holistic Approach to Continuous Development in South African HigherEducation Institutions", "abstract": "Abstract Challenges that South African HEIs (Higher Education Institutions face, include access, admission, funding, retention, output and academic teachers falling short in creating effective spaces for quality teaching in lecture rooms.

The service is globally acknowledged for the role it plays in supporting holistic student development as well as the academic retention and throughput objectives of higher education institutions. However, a review of the relevant literature reveals a lack of enquiry into the identity experiences of student counsellors working in higher education. The present study sought to address this lacuna by conducting a qualitative investigation into the identity experiences of South African psychologists working in the context of a broad and diverse student counselling practice. The study was concerned with how and why these professionals come to perceive their identities in a particular way, as well as the influences impacting on this identity experience. A phenomenologicalconstructivist framework was adopted and Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) selected as the most appropriate methodology with which to explore this specific, localised experience. Convenience sampling was employed to access participants. A total of fourteen psychologists from the clinical, counselling and educational registration categories, participated in the study. Salient themes emerging from the research findings include the notion of the student counsellor as \"wearing many hats\" the student counsellor as developmental specialist; the student counsellor as institutional \"stepchild\" student counselling as a 'battleground' between context and profession, as well as the notion of student counselling as a territorial compromise. Research findings reveal a precarious and ambiguous position located in between the context of higher education and psychology profession. This unique position consequently engenders a great deal of ambivalence and conflict for the student counsellor, whose primary allegiance is to the psychology profession. Participants' experiences indicate that they value their identity as psychologists and seek to maintain a connection to the profession whilst working in student counselling. However, the study also highlights powerful systemic influences unique to higher education and the South African social context, which compel student counsellors to reevaluate and revise. The research findings further suggest that student counsellors' negotiate an amicable compromise by variously assuming 'Preferred Self' and 'Compliant Self' identity positions in the context of work activities, power dynamics and relationships with significant professional, community and institutional others. On a broader level, the identity negotiation and reconstruction processes undergone by student counsellors serves as a metaphorical illustration of how a once divided South African population may be reconciled. Research findings have important transformative implications for higher education and the profession of psychology in South Africa, with student counsellors' work experiences suggesting a revision of current Eurocentric psychological models of training and practice in the South African context. This study specifically calls for a review of current registration categories and scopes of practice in South Africa, particularly its relevance to the South African student population and broader society. Strong parallels are drawn between student counselling, with its flexible, contextually relevant approach and the systemically driven principles and values of community psychology; student counselling therefore appears to bridge the gap between mainstream psychology's narrow, Eurocentric approach and community psychology's systemic understanding of South African realities. The \"step child\" status of the student counsellor draws attention to a disjuncture between government legislation designed to promote institutional transformation in post apartheid South Africa, and the actual policies and practices implemented by higher education institutions themselves. This study highlights, in particular, a perceived conflict between higher education's narrow, traditional academic orientation and student counselling's broader cognizance of the complex socio historical needs and challenges of a diverse South African student population.

In addition, key milestones (time of registration, participation in a first year experience (FYE) course, declaring a major) were also examined to determine whether these events predicted retention.

A central aim of this course or master class is to suggest a path to mastery of this inequality, its many extensions, and its many applications from the most basic to the most sublime. The Typical Plan The typical chapter in this course is built around the solution of a small set of challenge problems. Sometimes a challenge problem is drawn from one of the world's famous mathematical competitions, but more often a problem is chosen because it illustrates a mathematical technique of wide applicability. Ironically, our first challenge problem is an exception. To be sure, the problem hopes to offer honest coaching in techniques of importance, but it is unusual in that it asks you to solve a problem that you are likely to have seen before. Nevertheless, the challenge is sincere; almost everyone finds some difficulty directing fresh thoughts toward a familiar problem. Problem 1.1 Prove Cauchy's inequality. Moreover, if you already know a proof of Cauchy's inequality, find another one! Coaching for a Place to Start How does one solve a problem in a fresh way? Obviously there cannot be any universal method, but there are some hints that almost always help. One of the best of these is to try to solve the problem by means of a specific principle or specific technique. Here, for example, one might insist on proving Cauchy's inequality 1", "venue": "", "year": 2004.0, "author_names": ["J Michael Steele"], "n_citations": 1, "n_key_citations": 0, "score": 0}, {"corpus_id": 11628739, "title": "The Cauchy Schwarz Master Class: Consequences of Order", "abstract": "One of the natural questions that accompanies any inequality is the possibility that it admits a converse of one sort or another. When we pose this question for Cauchy's inequality, we find a challenge problem that is definitely worth our attention. It not only leads to results that are useful in their own right, but it also puts us on the path of one of the most fundamental principles in the theory of inequalities the systematic exploitation of order relationships.

Orientation Part of the challenge here is that the problem is not fully framed there are circumstances and conditions that remain to be determined. Nevertheless, uncertainty is an inevitable part of research, and practice with modestly ambiguous problems can be particularly valuable. In such situations, one almost always begins with some experimentation and since the case n 1 is trivial, the simplest case worth study is given by taking the vectors (1, a) and (1, b) with a 0 and b 0.

Many prior works require paired, aligned demonstrations and an additional RL procedure for the task. However, paired, aligned demonstrations are seldom obtainable and RL procedures are expensive. In this work, we formalize the Cross Domain Imitation Learning (CDIL) problem, which encompasses imitation learning in the presence of viewpoint and embodiment mismatch. Informally, CDIL is the process of learning how to perform a task optimally, given demonstrations of the task in a distinct domain. We propose a two step approach to CDIL: alignment followed by adaptation. In the alignment step we execute a novel unsupervised MDP alignment algorithm, Generative Adversarial MDP Alignment (GAMA) to learn state and action correspondences from unpaired, unaligned demonstrations. In the adaptation step we leverage the correspondences to zero shot imitate tasks across domains. To describe when CDIL is feasible via alignment and adaptation, we introduce a theory of MDP alignability.

For humans to provide reliable assessments of an SI system, they must possess a sufficient degree of domain knowledge, which can place significant limitations on the pool of participants. Furthermore, both human bias against computer generated artifacts, and the variability of participants' assessments call the reliability of the results into question. Most importantly, the use of human participants places limitations on the number of generated artifacts and SI systems which can be feasibly evaluated. Directly motivated by these shortcomings, CAEMSI provides a robust and scalable approach to the evaluation problem. Normalized Compression Distance, a domain independent distance metric, is used to measure the distance between individual artifacts within a corpus.

It requires models to recognize isolated sign words from videos. However, annotating WSLR data needs expert knowledge, thus limiting WSLR dataset acquisition. On the contrary, there are abundant subtitled sign news videos on the internet. Since these videos have no word level annotation and exhibit a large domain gap from isolated signs, they cannot be directly used for training WSLR models. We observe that despite the existence of a large domain gap, isolated and news signs share the same visual concepts, such as hand gestures and body movements. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel method that learns domain invariant visual concepts and fertilizes WSLR models by transferring knowledge of subtitled news sign to them. To this end, we extract news signs using a base WSLR model, and then design a classifier jointly trained on news and isolated signs to coarsely align these two domain features. In order to learn domain invariant features within each class and suppress domain specific features, our method further resorts to an external memory to store the class centroids of the aligned news signs. We then design a temporal attention based on the learnt descriptor to improve recognition performance.

The application of machine learning in the oil industry is also actively expanding. To solve oil recovery problems, it is necessary to use geological models of reservoir fields. With increasing of the reservoir model complexity (size) the computing time also increases. Therefore, it takes longer to predict oil recovery. There are two approaches to solve this problem. The first approach is to develop an effective parallel algorithm taking into account the heterogeneity of computing systems. Many scientists from all over the world are developing parallel algorithms in this field. In particular, we have written many scientific papers. The disadvantage of using this approach is that when you change the initial data for the oil recovery prediction, you need to make calculations on supercomputers every time, which takes a lot of time and resources. The second approach is to use machine learning methods, which is the purpose of this paper. This paper discusses approaches to using effective machine learning methods for oil recovery prediction. To train the system, we used historical data from the oil field and synthetic data obtained from surrogate models based on two wells (injection and production) Synthetic data were generated based on mathematical models (oil displacement models, enhanced oil recovery models) by varying the different geological parameters. This problem belongs to the \"supervised learning\" type of machine learning. Supervised learning requires a complete set of marked data for training the model at all stages of its construction. When implementing the algorithm, we considered machine learning methods for solving the regression and classification problems. As a result, it was discovered that compared to traditional computational experiments on a regular grid, calculations using machine learning methods are more productive.", "venue": "", "year": 2020.0, "author_names": ["B S Daribayev", "D Zh Akhmed-Zaki", "Timur Imankulov", "Y S Nurakhov", "Yerzhan Kenzhebek"], "n_citations": 0, "n_key_citations": 0, "score": 1}, {"corpus_id": 222177959, "title": "Machine learning for recovery factor estimation of an oil reservoir: a tool for de risking at a hydrocarbon asset evaluation", "abstract": "Well known oil recovery factor estimation techniques such as analogy, volumetric calculations, material balance, decline curve analysis, hydrodynamic simulations have certain limitations.

Besides, though uncertainty estimation is highly desirable for this problem, the methods above do not include this by default. In this work, we present a data driven technique for oil recovery factor of hydrocarbon reservoirs using parameters and various representative statistics. We apply advanced machine learning methods using extensive historical worldwide oilfields datasets (more than 2000 oil reservoirs) The data driven model might be used as a general tool for rapid and completely objective estimation of the oil recovery factor. In addition, it includes the ability to work with partial input data and to estimate the prediction interval of the oil recovery factor. We perform the evaluation in terms of accuracy and prediction intervals coverage for several tree based machine learning techniques in application to the following two cases: (1) using parameters only related to geometry, geology, transport, storage and fluid properties, (2) using an extended set of parameters including development and production data. For both cases model proved itself to be robust and reliable.

Prior to study the flow behaviors and phase transitions in multi component multiphase flow, the first effort should be focused on the accurate prediction of the total phase numbers existing in the fluid mixture, and then the phase equilibrium status can be determined. In this paper, a novel and fast prediction technique is proposed based on deep learning method. The training data is generated using a selected VT dynamic flash calculation scheme and the network constructions are deeply optimized on the activation functions. Compared to previous machine learning techniques proposed in literatures to accelerate vapor liquid phase equilibrium calculation, the total number of phases existing in the mixture is determined first and other phase equilibrium properteis will be estimated then, so that we do not need to ensure that the mixture is in two phase conditions any more. Our method could handle fluid mixtures with complex compositions, with 8 different components in our example and the original data is in a large amount.

However, the performance evaluation of SAGD in heavy oil reservoirs usually involves time consuming and tedious static and dynamic numerical simulations, which is not suitable for practical decision making and prediction. As a reliable alternative modeling tool, the deep learning based model has great potential for comprehensive data analysis and system prediction of machine learning methods. Still, it has not been widely used in SAGD development planning. In this paper, a recurrent neural network model is applied to the prediction of SAGD production information. A large number of simulation results are collected using CMG software to build a training database, which includes static parameters describing various characteristics of the reservoir and dynamic parameters for production control. The deep learning based model is divided into two parts. One part is responsible for predicting the thermal communication in the preheating stage, and the other part is responsible for predicting the production information in the production stage, using the principal component analysis method to reduce the dimension of the input vector, limiting the overfitting and improving the quality of the prediction. Besides, an intelligent history matching technology for oilfield SAGD production is proposed.

Conventional tests to determine gas oil MMP such as rising bubble apparatus and slim tube displacement are either costly or time consuming.

In recent years, computational psychiatry has emerged as a field that combines multiple levels and types of data and computational modeling to improve understanding, prediction, and treatment of mental illness. Mental health patients often undergo a variety of non invasive (e.g. cognitive counseling) and invasive (e.g. surgery) therapies before finding an e|ective treatment plan. Improved prediction of treatment response can shorten the duration of clinical trials and improve patient experience and outcomes. A key challenge of applying predictive modeling to this problem is that often, the e|ectiveness of a treatment regimen remains unknown for several weeks. In this thesis, we propose Machine Learning approaches to extracting audio visual features for predicting the likely outcome of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) treatment several weeks in advance for patients suffering from major depressive disorder, a common psychiatric illness for which there are no objective, non verbal, automated markers that can reliably track treatment response. We first explore the use of video analysis of facial expressivity in a cohort of severely depressed patients before and after DBS. We introduce a set of variability measurements to obtain unsupervised features from muted video recordings. We then leverage the link between short term emotions and long term depressed mood states and use a neural network model on the top of emotion based audio features. The results show that unsupervised features extracted from these audio and video recordings, when incorporated in classification models, can discriminate di|erent levels of depression severity during ongoing DBS treatment. Moreover, for the long term prediction and in the absence of immediate treatment response feedback, we utilize a joint state estimation and temporal di|erence learning approach to model both the trajectory of a patient's response and the delayed nature of feedbacks using deep neural networks. The results based on longitudinal recordings of patients with depression show that the learned state values are predictive of the long term success of DBS treatments. Our findings suggest that Machine Learning models can discover objective biomarkers of depression and patient response to treatments, which have the potential to standardize treatment protocols and enhance the design of future clinical trials.

METHODS This study used the Taiwan Stroke Registry (TSR) which has prospectively collected data from stroke patients since 2006. Three known ML models (support vector machine, random forest, and artificial neural network) and a hybrid artificial neural network were implemented and evaluated by 10 time repeated hold out with 10 fold cross validation.

However, manufacturing processes are prone to imperfections that may degrade sometimes catastrophically the intended functionality of the fabricated circuits. Extensive production tests are then needed in order to separate these defective or unreliable parts from functionally correct devices. Unfortunately, the co integration of blocks of very distinct nature (analog, mixed signal, digital, RF, as well as the limited access to internal nodes in an integrated system make the test of these devices a very challenging and costly task. BIST techniques have been proposed as a way to overcome these issues. These techniques aim at including some of the ATE functionality into the Device Under Test, in such a way that each fabricated system becomes self testable. Applying BIST to the digital part of a complex integrated system is a common and standardized practice. Many test alternatives broadly proven in practice are available, all of them based on defect test and fault models. On the other hand, AMS RF BIST techniques are still lagging behind due to the strict requirements imposed by the analog circuitry. Since AMS RF circuits are usually tested by measuring their functional specifications, this means that each measurement has to comply with strict accuracy constraints to match the performance of the circuits under test. A promising solution to these issues is the combination of BIST strategies and machine learning based tests. Machine learning test strategies replace costly analog, mixed signal and RF performance measurements by a set of simpler measurements that can be performed on chip by low cost built in test circuitry. The core idea is to build a mapping model from a set of simple measurements to the set of functional specifications. However, this test strategy is not free of shortcomings either. My research has been focused on overcoming the limitations of current BIST and machine learning based test for complex AMS RF circuits, with the final goal of providing innovative state of the art test solutions for these complex systems", "venue": "", "year": 2019.0, "author_names": ["Manuel J Barragan"], "n_citations": 0, "n_key_citations": 0, "score": 0}]}

Methods Data from the population based Yorkshire Register of Diabetes in Children and Young People was used to analyse the incidence of Type 1 diabetes in children aged <15 years diagnosed in the former Yorkshire Regional Health Authority. Incidence rates (per 100 000 per year) were estimated using mid year population estimates stratified by sex, age and ethnicity: south Asian (Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi) or non south Asian (all other ethnicities) Ethnicity was assigned using two name recognition programs (Nam Pehchan and SANGRA) and a local expert. Age sex standardised rates were calculated between 1978 and 2007 and by ethnic group between 1990 and 2007. Poisson regression was used to assess incidence trends and estimate predicted rates up to 2020. Goodness of fit, AIC and likelihood ratio tests were used to assess model fit. Results 3896 children were diagnosed in Yorkshire between 1978 and 2007. Overall incidence was 18.1 (95% CI 17.5 to to 18.6) increasing from 13.3 (1978 to 1987) to 16.9 (1988 to 1997) to 24.1 (1998 to 2007) Incidence increased significantly over time: average annual percentage change (AAPC) was 2.8% (1.8 to 3.8) The inclusion of an age sex interaction term provided evidence for differences in trends between sexes depending on age, with females having higher incidence and AAPC than males for those aged 5 9. Overall incidence for non south Asians (21.4; 20.6 to 22.3) was significantly higher than that of south Asians (14.6; 12.3 to 17.0) over the entire study period. A significant increasing trend in incidence was observed for non south Asians of 3.3% (1.3 to 5.2) compared to a non significant trend seen in south Asians (1.9% 0.4 to 4.3) Overall forecasted incidence for 2020 is 38.3 per 100 000. Conclusions Type 1 diabetes incidence rates have risen almost uniformly for non south Asians of all ages but not for south Asians, contrary to findings in the Bradford area of Yorkshire between 1978 and 1998.

Our approach classifies the activity of interest as well as identifies the relevant foreground in the video. Each activity representation is considered as a mixture distribution of BoWs captured by a Sum Product Network (SPN) In our approach, SPN represents a linear mixture of many bags of words (BoWs) where each BoW represents an important foreground part of the activity. This mixture distribution is efficiently computed by organizing the BoWs in a hierarchy, where children BoWs are nested within parent BoWs. SPN allows us to model this mixture since it consists of terminal nodes representing BoWs, product nodes, and sum nodes organized in a number of layers. The products are aimed at encoding particular configurations of primitive actions, and the sums serve to capture their alternative configurations. SPN inference amounts to parsing the SPN graph, which yields the most probable explanation (MPE) of the video foreground. SPN inference has linear complexity in the number of nodes, under fairly general conditions, enabling fast and scalable recognition. The connectivity of SPN and the parameters of BoW distributions are learned under weak supervision using a variational EM algorithm.

Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) developed in 2006, can be viewed as a kind of online RL. This technique has greatly improved the level of Go playing programs. MCTS has since become the state of the art for many other games including Hex, Havannah, and general game playing, and has found much success in applications as diverse as scheduling, unit commitment problems, and probabilistic planning. DL has transformed fields such as image and video recognition and speech understanding. In computer games, DL started making its mark in 2014, when teams from the University of Edinburgh and Google DeepMind independently applied deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) to the problem of expertmove prediction in Go.Clark and Storkey's DCNN achieved a move prediction rate of 44% exceeding all previously published results. DeepMind's publication followed soon after, with a DCNN that reached 55% The combination of DL and RL led to great advances in Atari 2600 game playing, and to the ultimate breakthrough in computer Go. In 2017, DeepMind proposed a new deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm and developed AlphaGo Zero, which is significant for not requiring any human knowledge of Go. By removing the requirement for domain knowledge, DRL is also flexible in that the method can be applied to a wide range of games and problems, ushering in a variety of new research opportunities. In this special issue, we are delighted to bring you eight articles on applying DL/RL related techniques to games research.", "venue": "IEEE Trans.

On a parallel research track, self supervised contrastive learning recently achieved state of the art results on images clustering and, subsequently, image classification. Results We propose contrastive sc a new unsupervised learning method for scRNA seq data that perform cell clustering. The method consists of two consecutive phases: first, an artificial neural network learns an embedding for each cell through a representation training phase. The embedding is then clustered in the second phase with a general clustering algorithm (i.e. KMeans or Leiden community detection) The proposed representation training phase is a new adaptation of the self supervised contrastive learning framework, initially proposed for image processing, to scRNA seq data. contrastive sc has been compared with ten state of the art techniques.

Chi squared tests, principal component analysis (PCA) and multiple regression analysis were performed to determine which variables were possibly associated with infection. The variables considered were patients' wound parameters, wider vascular comorbidity and demographics. RESULTS A total of 136 patients, providing 383 wound swabs, were included in the study. Total agreement in terms of DFU wound assessment for infection between podiatrists' clinical opinion and Glycologic kit test result was observed in 79% of cases (301/383) For 56 of the 349 negative infection detection kit test results (16% podiatrists identified a 'possible' or 'definite' infection.

Research design and methods We aimed to determine whether patterns in plantar diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) recurrence coincided with typical intervals between routine preventive care appointments, which would suggest that delays exist between ulcer development and identification. We completed an analysis of existing data from two multicenter studies in 300 total participants. We analyzed unadjusted counts of DFU binned in weekly intervals and defined 'exam periods' as intervals from 2 to 4 weeks, from 6 to 8 weeks, within 1 week of 3 months and within 1 week of 6 months. We tested whether recurrence rates during exam periods were equivalent to rates outside exam periods. We estimated the delay between DFU development and DFU identification such that the rate of development would have been constant. Results During exam periods, a total of 43 DFUs were identified (43/86=50% despite the fact that these periods represent only 23.5% of follow up in aggregate. Accounting for censoring, the annualized incidence during exam periods was 0.68 DFU/year (CI 0.48 to 0.89) in contrast to 0.25 DFU/year (CI 0.18 to 0.32) outside exam periods (incidence ratio=2.8, CI 1.8 to 4.3) We estimated delays between DFU occurrence and identification to average 15.3 days (IQR 7.4 23.7 days) Conclusions These findings have potential implications for practice, particularly related to the value of telehealth and in home monitoring of patients in diabetic foot remission.

This is especially true in highly competitive consumer oriented industries, such as the automotive industry. The literature review presented herein indicated that most of the available sustainability frameworks are qualitative in nature and limited to discussion of sustainable materials and processes, while tradeoffs between the environmental, social and economic domains of sustainability are rarely examined. To overcome such shortcomings, we develop a quantitative framework for sustainable manufacturing and illustrate its application for the automotive industry. Multi criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is utilized to combine the values of industry executives and decision makers with performance criteria of different car manufacturing materials (ferrous metals, aluminum, plastics, organic composites, and synthetic composites) Our results show how material alternatives in manufacturing can be quantitatively selected based on sustainability objectives. Additionally, we illustrate how sensitivity analyses are used to assess the robustness of the resulting alternative selection.

However, rigorous environmental rules and policies pushed organizations to accept affirmative changes like green supply chain management practices in their processes of the supply chain. Selection of green supplier is a tedious task and comprises a lot of challenges starting from evaluation to their final selection, which is experienced by supplier management professionals. The development and implementation of practical decision making tools that seek to address these challenges are rapidly evolving. In the present work, the evaluation of a set of suppliers is primarily based on both conventional and environmental criteria. This work proposes a multi criteria decision making (MCDM) based framework that is used to evaluate green supplier selection by using an integrated fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) with the other three techniques namely MABAC \"Multi Attributive Border Approximation Area Comparison\" WASPAS \"Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment\" and TOPSIS \"Technique for order preference by similarity to ideal Solution\" Initially, six green supplier selection environmental criteria (Environmental management system, green image, staff environment training, eco design, pollution control, and resource consumption) and three conventional criteria (price, quality and service level) have been identified through literature review and expert's opinions to employ MCDM approach. A real world case study of the automotive industry in India is deliberated to exhibit the proposed framework applicability. From AHP findings, 'Environment management system' 'Pollution control' 'Quality' and 'Green image' have been ranked as the topmost four green supplier selection criteria. Besides, the consistency test was performed to check the uniformity of the expert's input whereas the 'robustness' of the approach was tested by performing sensitivity analysis. The results illustrate that the applied fuzzy hybrid methods reach common green supplier rankings. Moreover, out of the four green supplier's alternatives, supplier number 'one' got the highest rank. This shows that the applied models are robust in nature. Further, this study relinquishes a single platform for the selection of green supplier under fuzzy environment. The applied methodology and its analysis will provide insight to decision makers of supplier selection. It may aid decision makers and the procurement department not only to differentiate the significant green supplier selection criteria but also to assess the most efficient green supplier in the supply chain in the global market.", "venue": "Comput.

To address these questions, we applied several computational approaches to the EEG including graph mining, machine learning (i.e. support vector machine) and stability selection to investigate the unique brain states (functional neural connectivity) that predict the speed of listeners' behavioral decisions.

Most existing approaches solve this problem by mapping nodes into a vector space and performing unsupervised learning with the resulting embeddings. In cases where multiple types of connectivity patterns exist for the set of nodes, commonly modeled as multilayer graphs, new strategies are required to model the inter layer dependencies in order to perform effective inferencing. In this paper, we focus on learning embeddings for each node of a multilayer graph through neural modeling techniques, such that the complex dependencies can be concisely encoded into low dimensional representations. Referred to as multilayer graph embeddings, these representations can be utilized for discovering community structure in a scalable fashion, even with a large number of layers. Furthermore, in order to ensure that the semantics that persist over a longer range in the network are well modeled, we propose to refine the multilayer embeddings via a proxy clustering loss and a graph modularity measure. Using real world datasets, we demonstrate that this algorithm generates scalable and robust representations, and outperforms existing multilayer community detection approaches. Introduction Community Detection in Multilayer Graphs: Graphs are natural data structures to represent relational data, and hence modeling and inferencing with graph structured data have become central to a wide range of applications, such as social network analysis (Eagle and Pentland 2006) recommendation systems (Rao et al. 2015) neurological modeling (Fornito, Zalesky, and Breakspear 2013) etc. Though some of these applications require supervised or semi supervised learning formulations, mining large networks to identify cohesive clusters of densely connected nodes is a highly prevalent idea in the graph mining literature (Blondel et al. 2008; Kim and Lee 2015) Referred to as community detection, this unsupervised learning problem is most commonly addressed by mapping nodes into a vector space and performing clustering using the resulting embeddings (Dong et al. 2012; *This work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE AC52 07NA27344.

Ding, Lin, and Ishwar 2016; Yang et al. 2016) These latent low dimensional embeddings can be inferred by optimizing with a variety of measures that describe the network structure examples include decomposition of the graph Laplacian matrix (Ng, Jordan, and Weiss 2002) stochastic factorization of the adjacency matrix (Ahmed et al. 2013; Tang et al. 2015) and decomposition of the modularity matrix (Newman 2006; Chen, Kuzmin, and Szymanski 2014; Yang et al. 2016) etc. Until recently, the majority of existing work has focused on discovering community structure from a single network. However, with the emergence of multiview network data in real world scenarios, commonly represented as multilayer graphs, community detection has become more challenging. In general, multilayer graphs provide complementary views of connectivity patterns for the same set of nodes, thus requiring the need to model complex dependency structure across the views. The heterogeneity in the relationships, while providing richer information, makes statistical inferencing challenging. Furthermore, the varying levels of sparsity in different layers and the inherent uncertainties in neighborhoods, e.g. noisy edges or outliers, add to the complexity of this problem. Existing work on community detection from multilayer graphs can be broadly categorized into (a) methods that obtain a consensus community structure by fusing information from different layers and producing a single community label for the set of corresponding nodes (Dong et al. 2012; Dong et al. 2014; Kim, Lee, and Lim 2017; Tagarelli, Amelio, and Gullo 2017) and (b) methods that infer a separate embedding for a node in every layer, while exploiting the inter layer dependencies, and produce multiple potential community associations for each node (Mucha et al. 2010; Bazzi et al. 2016) In this paper, we address the problem of building effective latent embeddings for nodes on every layer from multilayer graph data, and our approach falls in the latter category. Constructing Node Embeddings: At their core, node embedding approaches attempt to identify low rank representations that can best represent the network topology. Despite their broad applicability, several of these approaches produce linear embeddings for nodes, naturally motivating the use of deep neural networks to potentially produce more expressive, non linear embeddings. Consequently, stacked graph auto encoder style solutions have been proposed ar X iv :1 81 1. 12 15 6v 1 cs .S I] 2 0 Se p 20 18 (Yang et al. 2016) that directly transform the objective measure (e.g. modularity matrix) into an undercomplete representation through a reconstruction cost. In addition to producing non linear mappings, deep learning approaches enable the use of robust reconstruction losses in lieu of a simple `2 measure (Thiagarajan et al. 2016) and supports the inclusion of additional prior constraints on community structure (Yang et al. 2016) A known limitation of node embedding techniques has been their scalability (e.g. Eigen value decomposition) with large scale graphs, and this issue persists even with graph autoencoders. In order to combat this limitation, recent approaches, such as DeepWalk (Perozzi, Al Rfou, and Skiena 2014) and Node2Vec (Grover and Leskovec 2016) have resorted to a distributional hypothesis, popularly adopted in language modeling (Harris 1954) where co occurrence of two nodes in short random walks implies a strong notion of semantic similarity. As a result, by extending highly scalable neural embedding techniques such as Word2Vec (Mikolov et al. 2013) to the construction of node embeddings, one can obtain state of the art results in community detection with single layer graphs. Proposed Work: In this paper, we develop a novel scalable technique for obtaining deep node embeddings from multilayer graphs. We show that a naive extension of DeepWalk to the multilayer case, that performs independent random walks on each of the layers, can be worse than even simple baselines, thus emphasizing the need to explicitly model dependencies across the different layers. Consequently, we propose to parameterize virtual edges to allow information flow between layers. Furthermore, the premise of using short random walks to infer the underlying semantic structure relies on the assumption that the networks are highly sparse and the node co occurrences follow a power law. However, by allowing inter layer edges, that assumption can be violated in cases where the semantics can persist over even longer walks. We address this challenge by including a refinement stage, where the multilayer embeddings are finetuned to produce more cohesive communities. In particular, we use entropy based proxy clustering cost and modularity based refinement. We show that the proposed approach is highly effective for as many as 37 layers and it outperforms existing approaches for multilayer community detection. Mathematical Preliminaries Definitions: A single layer undirected, unweighted graph is represented by G (V, E) where V denotes the set of nodes with cardinality |V| N and E denotes the set of edges. The goal of embedding techniques is to generate latent representations, X RNxd, where d is the desired number of latent dimensions. A multilayer graph is represented using a set of L inter dependent graphs G (V, E) for l 1, L, where there exists a node mapping between every pair of layers to indicate which vertices in one graph correspond to vertices in the other. Deep Embeddings for Network Analysis: The scalability challenge of factorization techniques has motivated the use of deep learning methods to obtain node embeddings. The earliest work to report results on this direction was the DeepWalk algorithm by Perozzi et al. (Perozzi, Al Rfou, and Skiena 2014) Interestingly, it draws analogy between node sequences generated by short random walks on graphs and sentences in a document corpus. Given this formulation, the authors utilize popular language modeling tools to obtain latent representations for the nodes (Mikolov et al. 2013) Let us consider a simple metric walkWt in step t, which is rooted at the vertex vi. The transition probability between the nodes vi and vj can be expressed as P (Wt+1 vj |Wt vi) h(|xi xj||2/s) (1) where |xi xj||2 indicates the similarity metric between the two vertices in the latent space to be recovered and h is a linking function that connects the vertex similarity to the actual co occurrence probability. With appropriate choice of the walk length, the true metric can be recovered accurately from the co occurrence statistics constructed using random walks. Furthermore, the authors note that the frequency in which vertices appear in the short random walks follows a power law distribution, similar to words in natural language. Given a length S sequence of words, (w0, w1, wS 1) wherews denotes a word in the vocabulary, neural word embeddings attempt to obtain vector spaces that can recover the likelihood of observing a word given its context, i.e. P (ws|w0, w1, ws 1) over all sequences. Extending this idea to the case of graphs, a random walk on the nodes, starting from node vi, produces the sequence analogous to sentences in language data. Modularity based Community Detection: A popular measure used in community detection algorithms is the modularity function Q (Newman 2006) defined as the difference between the number of edges within cohesive communities and the expected number of", "venue": "ArXiv", "year": 2018.0, "author_names": ["Huan Song", "Jayaraman J Thiagarajan"], "n_citations": 2, "n_key_citations": 0, "score": 0}, {"corpus_id": 209314283, "title": "Decoding of single trial EEG reveals unique states of functional brain connectivity that drive rapid speech categorization decisions.", "abstract": "Categorical perception (CP) is an inherent property of speech perception.

While the neural correlates of CP have been well studied in terms of the regional contributions of the brain to behavior, functional connectivity patterns that signify individual differences in listeners' speed (RT) for speech categorization is less clear. To address these questions, we applied several computational approaches to the EEG, including graph mining, machine learning (i.e. support vector machine) and stability selection to investigate the unique brain states (functional neural connectivity) that predict the speed of listeners' behavioral decisions. We infer that (i) the listeners' perceptual speed is directly related to dynamic variations in their brain connectomics, (ii) global network assortativity and efficiency distinguished fast, medium, and slow RT, (iii) the functional network underlying speeded decisions increases in negative assortativity (i.e. became disassortative) for slower RTs, (iv) slower categorical speech decisions cause excessive use of neural resources and more aberrant information flow within the CP circuitry, (v) slower responders tended to utilize functional brain networks excessively (or inappropriately) whereas fast responders (with lower global efficiency) utilized the same neural pathways but with more restricted organization.

The guideline oriented care of patients depends on early diagnosis and regular and valid evaluation of their treatment to be able to quickly intervene should the patient's mental health deteriorate. To ensure effective treatment, the level of experience of the physician or therapist is of importance, both in the initial diagnosis and in the treatment of mental illnesses. Nevertheless, experienced physicians and psychotherapists are not available in enough numbers everywhere, especially in rural areas or in less developed countries. Human speech can reveal a speaker's mental state by altering its noncontent aspects (speech melody, intonations, speech rate, etc) This is noticeable in both the clinic and everyday life by having prior knowledge of the normal speech patterns of the affected person, and with enough time spent listening to the patient. However, this time and experience are often unavailable, leaving unused opportunities to capture linguistic, noncontent information. To improve the care of patients with mental disorders, we have developed a concept for assessing their most important mental parameters through a noncontent analysis of their active speech. Using speech analysis for the assessment and tracking of mental health patients opens up the possibility of remote, automatic, and ongoing evaluation when used with patients' smartphones, as part of the current trends toward the increasing use of digital and mobile health tools. Objective The primary objective of this study is to evaluate measurements of participants' mental state by comparing the analysis of noncontent speech parameters to the results of several psychological questionnaires (Symptom Checklist 90 [SCL 90] the Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ] and the Big 5 Test) Methods In this paper, we described a case controlled study (with a case group and one control group) The participants will be recruited in an outpatient neuropsychiatric treatment center. Inclusion criteria are a neurological or psychiatric diagnosis made by a specialist, no terminal or life threatening illnesses, and fluent use of the German language. Exclusion criteria include psychosis, dementia, speech or language disorders in neurological diseases, addiction history, a suicide attempt recently or in the last 12 months, or insufficient language skills. The measuring instrument will be the VoiceSense digital voice analysis tool, which enables the analysis of 200 specific speech parameters, and the assessment of findings using psychometric instruments and questionnaires (SCL 90, PHQ, Big 5 Test) Results The study is ongoing as of September 2019, but we have enrolled 254 participants. There have been 161 measurements completed at timepoint 1, and a total of 62 participants have completed every psychological and speech analysis measurement. Conclusions It appears that the tone and modulation of speech are as important, if not more so, than the content, and should not be underestimated. This is particularly evident in the interpretation of the psychological findings thus far acquired. Therefore, the application of a software analysis tool could increase the accuracy of finding assessments and improve patient care.

The four factors (subjective norms, perceived behavioural control, attitudes and intentions) were consistent with the four TPB domains. The eTAP T demonstrated satisfactory validity and reliability as per the consensus based standards for the selection of health measurement instruments. Conclusions The development and preliminary psychometric investigation supported the validity and reliability of the eTAP T. Further research is required for confirmatory analyses. The eTAP T may be useful in identifying the training needs of MHPs and evaluating training programs. Specific areas for intervention, such as attitudes or perceived credibility may be identified and targetted, with the measure then also used to evaluate change across these domains. It is anticipated that the eTAP T may useful tool in improving uptake of digital interventions by MHPs.", "venue": "Internet interventions", "year": 2019.0, "author_names": ["Bonnie A Clough", "Dale Rowland", "Leanne M Casey"], "n_citations": 1, "n_key_citations": 0, "score": 0}, {"corpus_id": 3613158, "title": "Pre post, mixed methods feasibility study of the WorkingWell mobile support tool for individuals with serious mental illness in the USA: a pilot study protocol", "abstract": "Introduction Successful competitive employment has been found to be related to enhanced self esteem, higher quality of life and reduced mental health service use for individuals living with serious mental illnesses (SMIs) including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression.

What is the contribution of this paper? This study is a compilation of the studies that examine the use of virtual reality to treat social anxiety problems. It conveyed the characteristics of virtual reality interventions and presented a holistic view to the literature concerning it. What is its contribution to the practice? Experimental studies of using virtual reality practices can be planned, and research projects regarding different problem fields can be conducted. 297 Omer Ozer, Virtual reality in social anxiety dx.doi.org/10.14744/phd.2019.75010 environments. VR based treatment can be done in a variety of environments with the technological opportunities of researchers and their different exposure interventions. The most common environments are based on manipulating spectator reactions or performances before various spectator profiles. This study is a compilation of the studies that examine the use of VR to treat social anxiety. Its aim is to provide information about their results related to the studies in which VR interventions are used against the social anxiety problem in relation to the VR practices used in psychological assistance period, about the methodological characteristics of the studies, and about the current state in this regard in Turkey. The Use of Virtual Reality for Psychological Assistance VR has been used successfully to treat a variety of psychological problems. Compilation studies, experimental studies without control groups, randomized controlled studies and even meta analyses have been conducted in this field. VR is used to treat post traumatic stress disorder,[6 10] obsessivecompulsive disorder,[11 13] alcohol abuse,[14] eating disorders, problems related to body image[15,16] and schizophrenia.[17,18] VR has been used both as an intervention method and as a diagnostic tool. VR treatments are based on cognitive behavioral therapy, which was developed as a treatment for anxiety disorders and is related to exposure practices[19] They were first used for specific phobias such as arachnophobia,[20,21] acrophobia,[22,23] and flying phobia.[24 28] VR is also used to treat claustrophobia, common anxiety disorder and panic attacks. VR treatments for anxiety disorders are based on exposure/facing interventions. Exposure therapy involves confronting the stimulus that causes anxiety,[29] which may be objects such as snakes or spiders, environments such as busses, restaurants or meeting halls, or situations such as speaking before an audience or communicating with the opposite gender. The main point here is confronting the issues causing disorders. Exposure, which is based on a behavioral method, is often used with the interventions based on the cognitive behavioral approach. The literature includes several types of exposure therapy. One is in vivo exposure therapy. Individuals directly confront the cause of their anxiety in vivo exposure therapy. Putting a cynophobic person and a dog in the same environment is an example of in vivo exposure therapy. Another exposure therapy type is based on the objects or environment avoided by individuals. This type of exposure therapy is called imaginal exposure therapy.[29] Another treatment, interoceptive exposure therapy, involves replicating the physical sensations that occur during panic attacks.[30] The use of digital environments created with VR has become more common. Exposure therapy in digital environments is called in virtuo exposure therapy. Although VR can be used to treat almost all anxiety disorders, most of the studies of this topic concern social anxiety. The details of these studies are provided under the effect title. In addition to experimental research, there are meta analyses that evaluate the research on VR treatments. Opris et al.[31] Parsons and Rizzo,[32] and Powers and Emmelkamp,[33] who have studied VR interventions in anxiety disorders, performed similar studies. Opris et al.[31] evaluated studies of VR based exposure therapy and included 23 studies in their analysis. They found that VR based exposure therapy yields more positive results, and that it yields results similar to those of conventional cognitive behavioral approaches. Evidence also indicates that VR treatments are as effective as conventional approaches, that their effects are long lasting, and that they have a dosage response relationship. No significant differences were found between two methods in regard to in vivo exposure, VR and exposure interventions. Parsons and Rizzo's meta analysis[32] evaluated the effectiveness of VR based exposure therapy for anxiety problems and specific phobias and found that it was effective, although the number of analyses of moderator effects was limited due to inconsistent reporting in the literature. They included 21 studies in their meta analysis, and it was stated that VRbased exposure therapy was an effective clinical psychology treatment for all anxiety and phobia cases (social anxiety, arachnophobia, acrophobia, panic attacks with agoraphobia and flying phobia)[32] Powers and Emmelkamp's meta analysis[33] included 13 studies (n=397) They found that VR based exposure therapy has a significant effect, that findings are specific to the problem, and that it is effective for subjective stress levels, and cognitive and behavioral psychophysiology. They found that results are not related to sample sizes, and that there is an exposure response relationship in VRbased exposure therapy.[33] The Characteristics of Virtual Reality Treatments for Social Anxiety Disorder This section briefly describes the VR treatments for social anxiety, reviewing their common aspects, types of exposure therapy, the characteristics of study samples, and experimental patterns and scenarios. Studies of VR treatments for social anxiety have been conducted with control groups who were on the waiting list of certain studies,[3 5] who did exposure therapy using their imagination,[34,35] or in vivo exposure therapy,[36,37] making it possible to compare the effectiveness of the method with different intervention methods. The literature has study samples with different characteristics. They were generally conducted with clinical cases.[37,38] However, one study did not have a clinical sample,[39] and another did not clearly define its sample's characteristics.[40] The participants in most of the studies were diagnosed with social anxiety.[3,36,37,41] Bouchard et al.[36] used a program with scenarios such as giving a speech at a meeting, introducing oneself, talking to 298 Psikiyatri Hemsireligi Dergisi Journal of Psychiatric Nursing so called relatives in an apartment and communicating with an insistent salesperson. The same program was used by Klinger et al.[37] In the VR environment developed by Heuett and Heuett[35] for the purpose of reducing the fear of speaking before an audience, the subject stands on a stage in a conference room. Package programs can be purchased in accordance with study aims, and study specific VR environments can be developed.[35] Some VR environments are interactive, but some environments have been designed to be non interactive. The Effects of Virtual Reality Treatments for Social Anxiety Some studies have focused on whether VR environments actually cause anxiety before examining their effectiveness as a treatment for social anxiety. Pertaub, Slater and Barker[42] attempted to answer to this question and assessed the anxiety related reactions of individuals who made a presentation before virtual audiences of eight male avatars. The experiment used three different virtual audiences: emotionally neutral spectators who were static during the entire experiment, positive spectators who displayed sincere and appreciative behaviors toward the speakers, and negative spectators who were bored and displayed hostile expressions. The study found that the negative audience clearly caused anxiety, and the participants were anxious despite their awareness that the environment was virtual.[42] Owens and Beidel[43] assessed the effects of a VR environment on 21 participants with social anxiety disorder and 24 participants with no disorders. Their study was conducted to determine the effect of giving an in vivo speech before an audience in a VR environment on physiological and subjective stimulation. All the participants had more anxiety symptoms than they did in face to face interactions. The evidence indicated that the VR environment significantly increased pulse rates, electrothermal activity and sinus arrhythmia, and the subjects reported that they experienced anxiety. Another significant result is that there were no significant differences in their physiological measurements during the face to face speech and the speech in the VR environment. Another study did physiological measurements of 12 participants who were assigned tasks in both a VR environment and real life. There were significant increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and pulse rate as a response to all stressful tasks. There was also a physiological reaction. The VR treatments in the literature were reviewed from a different point of view, and their usefulness as a diagnosis instrument was assessed.[44] Among 119 participants, physiological measurements of 19 individuals who had the highest social anxiety scores and 18 individuals who had the lowest score in this regard were assessed. This pilot study found that VR solutions can also be used for diagnosis. These studies show that VR environments can successfully be used to diagnose anxiety reactions, and practices based on diagnostic assessment can be formed in the future. Only VR is used in some of the studies that examine its effectiveness as a treatment for social anxiety.

Lifestyle interventions enhance outcomes after cancer treatment but innovations and technology are needed to provide consistency and scalability. Interventions to support exercise and dietary modification in secondary care settings have been limited by the lack of personalisation, clinician time and resources. Community pharmacies are well positioned to provide lifestyle advice for people with cancer and long term conditions. This study is the first to develop a tailored lifestyle intervention using a computer algorithm to enable community pharmacists to provide personalised advice for cancer patients. Objective: To create a computer based algorithm to support community pharmacists to deliver a tailored lifestyle intervention for men during and after treatment for prostate cancer. Method: An observational study was conducted at two UK centres involving 83 men with prostate cancer who were 3 36 months' post diagnosis. Physical fitness, strength and cardiovascular health were assessed. Qualitative interviews were undertaken with 20 participants to understand their interpretation of the assessment and analysed using a framework analysis. These data were used to inform our computer based algorithm and lifestyle prescriptions. Results: Physical fitness varied across participants. Limb strength was categorised with upper body strength low for 40% of men compared to their age (40 out of 83) and lower limb strength (44 of 83) 53% of men were low in comparison to age normative values. The Siconolfi step test provided classification of cardiopulmonary fitness with 26.5% (22 of 83) men unable to complete level 1 with very low physical fitness and 41% (34 of 83) of men moderate completing stage 2 of the test.

Conclusion: We have developed a computer algorithm that uses simple, safe and validated assessments to provide tailored lifestyle advice which addresses specific areas of cardiovascular risk, strength and physical fitness in men with prostate cancer. It generates a real time lifestyle prescription at the point of care and has been integrated into the software platform used by pharmacies in the UK. The algorithm was integrated into the software platform used by pharmacies within the UK. INTRODUCTION Improving cancer survivors' lifestyle to reduce future health risks In 2012, there were more than 32 million people living beyond 5 years of a cancer diagnosis globally [1] and in the UK half of all people diagnosed will now survive 10 years or more [2] Cancer is increasingly being recognised as a chronic disease and survivors are at elevated risk of disease recurrence and cardio metabolic problems [3, 4] Comorbid conditions such as obesity, hypertension, chronic heart disease and mental health problems, which are commonly reported in cancer survivors [5 7] are linked with poorer survival, reduced quality of life and higher healthcare costs [8] Evidence for the positive impact of lifestyle interventions in relation to recovery from cancer and reducing comorbidity has been well documented in several systematic reviews and meta analyses [911] Real time assessments of health and function are needed to support effective lifestyle interventions in follow up care and this is increasingly important as survivorship services are transferred to primary and community care settings [12, 13] Technology supported physical activity and nutrition interventions are an opportunity to deliver health interventions to adults with cancer, however current programmes lack an evidence base for benefit [14] The number of men with prostate cancer living longer is increasing because of improvements in diagnosis and the introduction of better treatments [15] Prostate cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in developed countries [1] and 1.1 million men are diagnosed per year globally. This accounts for 15% of all cancer diagnoses in men [16] In the United Kingdom (UK) over 47,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year and 84% are now surviving 10 years or more [17] Enhancing men's health by addressing factors such as obesity and physical inactivity are vital, as excess body weight and poor lifestyle behaviours are associated with increased risk of prostate cancer recurrence, aggressiveness and comorbidity [18 20] Furthermore, prostate cancer treatments such as androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) widely used as an adjunct for localised and high risk disease, have been associated with adverse cardiovascular effects [21 26] Specific lifestyle recommendations for men on ADT exist in the UK with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) advocating a 12 week exercise programme to reduce fatigue symptoms [27] Cardio oncology recommendations for people with cancer on hormone therapies advise pre assessment of existing cardiovascular disease and lifestyle intervention to reduce risk of adverse effects [28 30] There is a growing requirement to include lifestyle interventions as part of the cancer pathway, with recent reports highlighting the value of prehabilitation and rehabilitation for recovery [31 33] Community pharmacy have a role in supporting cancer survivors Improved survivorship has shifted cancer care from secondary to primary and community care, providing links to existing health and well being services. Lifestyle or physical activity on prescription schemes (PARs) for individuals with long term conditions have been implemented in primary care settings for promoting health in a range of conditions [34 36] However, people with cancer are included as eligible 'at risk' populations only in Australia and New Zealand [37] PARs aim to increase a patient's physical activity levels via general practitioner or nurse referral to a specialist sport and exercise practitioner led supervised exercise programme [38] Such interventions have been shown to increase self reported physical activity and improve health but have the recognised issues of poor adherence and high costs [39 41] Increasingly, pharmacy teams are being encouraged to provide brief interventions to promote obesity management and increase physical activity in people with long term conditions, as a supplement to such schemes [42] Community pharmacies are well positioned to provide general lifestyle advice for people with cancer due to their experience with health checks, smoking cessation and obesity management [43 45] High street pharmacists are accessible and understand behavioural change techniques [43] Pharmacists can enquire about physical activity at medicine reviews, refer their clients to local services and integrate brief advice about physical activity into routine consultations [46] However, for such advice to be most effective it needs to be responsive to the person's own lifestyle needs, co morbidities and existing level of physical fitness. Community pharmacists have limited training in physical activity assessment, knowledge of exercise advice or cancer treatment adverse effects but with more training and support tools, could effectively deliver lifestyle interventions for cancer survivors [47, 48] Pharmacists also need skills in motivating men to maintain and adhere to healthy lifestyle changes [49] The challenge is to ensure that lifestyle interventions are personalised, appealing and accessible [50] This requires innovations in assessment and technology tools that can be used within existing computer technology used by pharmacy teams. Developing algorithm led computer interventions for pharmacy Remote support for lifestyle interventions is a growing area of patient care, which is driven by the rising use of internet, smartphones and mobile technology [51, 52] Digital health behaviour change interventions (DCBIs) have mainly focused on direct communication with patients using text messages, email and web based applications [53] These have been shown to be successful in empowering people with long term conditions [54] and cancer survivors [55] and can be used to promote lifestyle change and increase physical activity [56] Digital technology holds promise to encourage behaviour change but needs methodologies and tailored approaches to promote user engagement [14, 53] Computer based tailoring is a method of assessing individuals and selecting communication content using data driven decision rules that produce feedback automatically from a database of content elements [57] The use of use of computer based tailoring for supporting lifestyle interventions in a community pharmacy setting is unique and is based on the recommended guidance for developing digital interventions to promote behaviour change in health and healthcare [53] In this study, we assessed: (i) objective measurements of cardio metabolic health, strength and physical fitness of men with prostate cancer that could be undertaken within a pharmacy, (ii) how to communicate risk and promote lifestyle behaviour change, and (iii) developed a computer algorithm to provide a safe and personalised lifestyle prescription at the point of care.", "venue": "", "year": 2019.0, "author_names": ["Jennifer Spink BMedSci"], "n_citations": 0, "n_key_citations": 0, "score": 0}, {"corpus_id": 209501606, "title": "Study protocol: The Dutch 20|30 Postmeningitis study: a cross sectional follow up of two historical childhood bacterial meningitis cohorts on long term outcomes", "abstract": "BackgroundBacterial meningitis (BM) is a serious, life threatening infectious disease of the central nervous system that often occurs in young children. The most common severe to moderate sequelae following BM are sensorineural hearing loss, neuromotor disabilities and mental retardation, while subtle sequelae include academic and behavioral disabilities. It is largely unknown whether these more subtle sequelae persist into adolescence and adulthood. Therefore, this study will investigate the very long term effects of childhood BM in later life. Better understanding of long term effects and early identification of adverse outcomes after BM are essential for more timely interventions. Additionally, certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with disease severity and might predict adverse sequelae. These include SNPs in genes encoding for pathogen recognition and immune response upon infection. Accordingly, a secondary objective of this study is to investigate the role of genetic variation in BM and use any insights to predict short and long term outcomes.MethodsIn the Dutch 20|30 Postmeningitis study, adolescents and young adults (n 947) from two historical cohorts with a prior episode of BM during childhood will be enrolled into a cross sectional follow up investigation using mainly questionnaires that examine executive and behavioral functioning, health related quality of life, subjective hearing, mood and sleeping disorders, academic performance, and economic self sufficiency. The results will be compared to normative data by one sample t tests. Multivariable regression analysis will be used to assess for any associations with causative pathogens and severity of BM. Participants that complete the questionnaires will be approached to provide a swab for buccal DNA and subsequent sequencing analyses. Logistic regression models will be used to predict sequelae.DiscussionThe unique follow up duration of this cohort will enable us to gain insights into the possible very long term adverse effects of childhood BM and how these might impact on quality of life. The investigation of host genetic factors will contribute to the development of prediction models which will serve as prognostic tools to identify children who are at high risk of adverse outcome after BM.Trial RegistrationDutch Trial Register NTR 6891.

Such sleep difficulties are a problem in their own right, but increasingly it is being recognised that they may also be a contributory factor in the development of a wide range of mental health problems. Our focus is upon the relationship between insomnia and psychotic experiences, such as paranoia and hallucinations. Psychotic experiences commonly occur in mild forms in the general population and have been linked to disrupted sleep. These psychotic like experiences raise the risk of development of a clinical disorder. Our aim is to reduce insomnia in a large general population group, and examine the effect on paranoia and hallucinations at the age when mental health problems typically emerge. The primary hypotheses are that cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for insomnia will reduce insomnia and also levels of paranoia and hallucinations. The theoretical links will be substantiated by a planned mediation analysis. Improvements in a number of other mental health outcomes are also predicted.Methods/DesignWe will carry out a parallel group, randomised controlled trial of 2,614 students with insomnia in universities across the UK. In the Oxford Access for Students Improving Sleep (OASIS) trial, participants will be randomised to digital CBT for insomnia (in addition to treatment as usual) or treatment as usual. Online assessments will take place at zero, three, 10 (post treatment) and 22 (follow up) weeks. Primary outcomes are insomnia and psychotic like experiences (paranoia or hallucinatory experiences) at 10 weeks. Secondary outcomes are levels of mania, depression, anxiety, nightmares, psychological wellbeing, and the development of mental health disorders.

Insel, announced his departure from the NIMH to lead Google's Life Sciences Mental Health Division. His decision attracted global attention. Interestingly for the field of mental health, Google intends to only back innovations expected to be ten times \"10x\" better than competitors. Indeed, mental health care and research are beset with myriad challenges that may be better tackled using the informatic capacity that tech giants can leverage. The field of mental health captures arguably the largest amount of data of any medical specialty, given that it encompasses behaviour, the brain and the mind. The physical neuroscience of psychiatry is augmented by high resolution neuroimaging of various modalities, as well as \"omic\" data including genomics, epigenomics, proteomics, microbiomics and metabolomics. The growth of such big data aggregation in psychiatry provides unprecedented opportunities for exploration, descriptive observation, hypothesis generation, and prediction for clinical, research and business/operational issues. The scale of data outputs, however, means that computer models are required to assist humans to find and comprehend meaning and delineate non obvious patterns converting data to information, knowledge and wisdom. Computerized analysis of complex human behaviours such as speech may present an opportunity to move psychiatry beyond reliance on self report and clinical observation toward more objective measures of health and illness in the individual patient. A recent pilot study used automated speech analyses to predict later psychosis onset in youths at clinical high risk for psychosis1. The analysis assessed for semantic coherence and two syntactic markers of speech complexity. These speech features predicted psychosis development with 100% accuracy and outperformed classification from structured clinical interviews. Electronic health records (EHRs) have changed the landscape of clinical data collecting and sharing, facilitating more efficient care delivery. They provide multiple types of data about individual patient encounters, as well as longitudinal data about a patient's medical history over an extended period of time (see Hayes et al2 in this issue of the journal) An example of the value of EHR data comes from a study which developed a statistical suicide risk stratification model3. The model resulted from examining suicide attempts and completed suicide in a large cohort of patients who underwent assessment in a regional health service. Researchers compared EHR based predictions of suicidal behaviour at 3 months with clinician predictions, which were based on a checklist. The model derived EHR was superior (area under the ROC curves, AUC=0.79 vs. 0.58 using the checklist) Big biomedical data are currently scattered across databases, and intentionally isolated to protect patient privacy. Linking big data will enable physicians and researchers to test new hypotheses and identify areas of possible intervention4. An example of the value of data linkage between genomics and EHRs comes from a large scale application of the phenome wide association study (PheWAS) paradigm5. The researchers scanned for associations between 2,476 single nucleotide polymorphisms (previously implicated by genome wide association studies as mediators of human traits) and 539 EHR derived phenotypes in 4,268 individuals of European ancestry. Several new PheWAS findings were identified, including a cluster of association near the NDFIP1 gene for mental retardation, and an association near PLCL1 gene for developmental delays and speech disorder. With the number of smart devices (i.e. smartphones and tablets) reaching into the billions worldwide, there are increasing opportunities to harness their power and multifunctionality for clinical use. There are now several examples of psychoeducation based products in use for depression, bipolar disorder, dementia and psychological distress. Smartphones also have capacity to offer telemental health functions. These functions are increasingly viewed as useful opportunities for more rapid patient clinician engagement and offering services to geographically isolated areas. They are reported to be as good as in person care for diagnosis and treatment in comparative and non inferiority studies. However, there are concerns about effects on the therapeutic alliance, and more research is required in specific populations (i.e. geriatric, child and minorities)6. With the huge number of \"apps\" available to patients and clinicians, it is important to use sensible approaches to analyzing clinical value. A Mobile App Rating Scale has been developed7, and there are websites available which appraise digital mental health programs. Recent years have seen the rise and miniaturization of many wearable sensors, for personal health care, fitness and activity awareness, as well as the wireless networking of these devices with EHRs and smartphones. These innovations also coincide with the popularity of patient owned health records, community based management of disease aiming to avoid hospitalization, and finally participatory health care, where patients are hypothetically empowered for health behaviour change through accessing their own health data. Smart and connected health care aims to accelerate the development and use of innovative approaches that would support the much needed transformation of health care from reactive and hospital centered to preventive, proactive, evidence based, person centered and focused on well being rather than disease. The opportunities afforded by tech giants moving into mental health, with their capital, digital and data analysis tools, and human resource talent pools, provide much hope for mental health sufferers around the world. While the encounter of electronic approaches with health is not without its risks, surrounding data privacy, use and storage, its potential is overt8. The engagement of tech giants also raises many questions for how we train our next generation of researchers and clinicians. Convergence science involves the transdisciplinary integration of fields including computer science, physics, engineering, medicine, chemistry, mathematics, the arts and biology; synergy between government, academia and industry is also critical. Convergence psychiatry involves embedding convergence science into the clinical mental health care setting by closer integration of scientists, clinicians and industry, as well as enhanced education of health professionals. This approach is critical, given modern psychiatric research problems are characterized by their complexity, multi systemic nature and broad societal impact, hence making them poorly suited to siloed approaches of thinking and innovation. Care must be taken to ensure researchers and clinicians are exposed to these frontier fields, and potential mechanisms include hackathons (intensive collaborations with coders, designers and managers on projects to meet a specific brief) multidisciplinary research groups, educational systems involving convergence science concepts, and industry academic collaborations.

Purpose To summarize evidence on the benefits and harms of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments for motor deficits and mood disorders in adults who have had stroke. Data Sources English language searches of multiple electronic databases from April 2009 through July 2018; targeted searches to December 2018 for studies of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Study Selection 19 systematic reviews and 37 randomized controlled trials addressing therapies for motor deficits or mood disorders in adults with stroke. Data Extraction One investigator abstracted the data, and quality and GRADE assessment were checked by a second investigator. Data Synthesis Most interventions (for example, SSRIs, mental practice, mirror therapy) did not improve motor function. High quality evidence did not support use of fluoxetine to improve motor function. Moderate quality evidence supported use of cardiorespiratory training to improve maximum walking speed and repetitive task training or transcranial direct current stimulation to improve activities of daily living (ADLs) Low quality evidence supported use of robotic arm training to improve ADLs. Low quality evidence indicated that antidepressants may reduce depression, whereas the frequency and severity of antidepressant related adverse effects was unclear. Low quality evidence suggested that cognitive behavioral therapy and exercise, including mind body exercise, may reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. Limitation Studies were of poor quality, interventions and comparators were heterogeneous, and evidence on harms was scarce. Conclusion Cardiorespiratory training, repetitive task training, and transcranial direct current stimulation may improve ADLs in adults with stroke. Cognitive behavioral therapy, exercise, and SSRIs may reduce symptoms of poststroke depression, but use of SSRIs to prevent depression or improve motor function was not supported.

The achievements of editorial board members can create benchmarks for research excellence and can be used to evaluate both individual and institutional performance. This paper proposes a new method based on journal editor data for assessing an institution's scholarly impact. In this paper, a journal editorship index (JEI) that simultaneously accounts for the journal rating (JR) editor title (ET) and board size (BS) is constructed. We assess the scholarly impact of economics institutions based on the editorial boards of 211 economics journals (which include 8640 editorial board members) in the ABS Academic Journal Guide. Three indices (JEI/ET, JEI/JR, and JEI/BS) are also used to rank the institutions. It was found that there was only a slight change in the relative institutional rankings using the JEI/ET and JEI/BS compared to the JEI. The BS and ET weight factors did not have a substantial influence on the ranking of institutions.

It covers scholarly related information for both researcher's perspective as well as publisher's perspective, such as academic activities, author's demography, academic social networks, etc. The relationships among Big Scholarly Data can be worthy of solving researcher as well as journal related concerns, if they are prudently treated to extract knowledge. The best approach to efficiently process these relationships is the graph. However, with the rapid growth in the number of digital articles by various libraries, the relationships raise exponentially, generating large graphs, which have become increasingly challenging to be handled in order to analyze scholarly information. On the other hand, many researchers and publishers/journals have severe concerns about the ranking control mechanisms and the consideration of quantity rather than quality. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed graph based mechanisms to perform four critical decisions that are the need of the today's scholarly community. To improve the quality of the article, we proposed a mechanism for selecting and recommending suitable reviewers for a submitted paper based on researchers' expertise and their popularity in that particular field while avoiding conflict of interest. Also, due to shortcomings in the existing journal ranking approaches, we also designed a journal ranking mechanism including its new impact factor and relative ranking by using a modified version of traditional page ranking algorithm and excluding self authors citations as well as self journal citations. Similarly, researchers ranking is also important for various motives that is calculated based on the expert's field, citation count, and a number of publications while avoiding any loophole to increase the ranking such as, self citations and wrong citations. Also, to efficiently process big graphs generated by a massive number of scholarly related relationships, we proposed an architecture that uses the parallel processing mechanism of the Hadoop ecosystem over the real time analysis approach of Apache Spark with GraphX.

Student Evaluation of Teaching", "abstract": "Bargaining regarding faculty evaluation is challenging in an environment in which administrators throughout higher education have successfully imposed corporate style forms of evaluation and supervision that many have come to accept as normal, despite their incompatibility with principles of academic freedom and peer review. Student surveys of teaching are increasingly central to this management strategy, despite the growing body of evidence indicating bias against historically marginalized groups in student survey results. In our presentation we will discuss our 2016 contract negotiations at Dutchess Community College (SUNY) in Poughkeepsie, New York as a case study. During these negotiations the college administration sought to expand the use of \"student evaluations\" of teaching (SET) despite significant evidence that student feedback provides limited meaningful evaluative content concerning teaching and is shaped by gender, racial, and ethnic bias, as well as bias against academic rigor. Our presentation will briefly describe our effort to maintain a peer based evaluation of student survey data, including the published research we used during negotiations, and we will analyze the strengths and weaknesses of our approach and results. These results include: a successful effort to maintain the practice of limiting review of qualitative student feedback to peer based review between faculty and department chairs within academic departments limited but significant expansion of administrative oversight of some quantitative student survey data contract language that limits the use of student survey results in faculty evaluation contract language that requires that all consideration of these data shall be undertaken with the understanding that student feedback is an important but limited vehicle for understanding the effectiveness of an individual's teaching contract language that established an all faculty committee of full time and part time faculty that is charged with evaluating the new survey form and process Background: During the last contract negotiations undertaken between Dutchess United Educators (DUE) the union representing faculty and most professional staff at Dutchess Community College, and the L. Akins and L. Murphy, NCSCBHEP 2019 1 1 Akins and Murphy: Panel: Peer Based Faculty Evaluation v. Student Evaluation of Tea Published by The Keep, 2019 college administration, DUE negotiators were confronted with a demand to change the long established process of faculty evaluation and use of student surveys of teaching that would affect both full time and part time faculty. The decades old full time faculty evaluation process involved two reports produced by the faculty member's department chair and submitted to the Dean of Academic Affairs: (1) a classroom observation report and (2) a professional development report (PDR) that covered teaching effectiveness, student advisement, professional activities, and contributions to the department and college. Additionally, student surveys of teaching were administered on paper in all course sections every spring with results going to the faculty member's department chair and eventually returned to the faculty member. These surveys included statements to be rated on a Likert scale as well as opportunities for students to respond to reflective questions. Survey data was not compiled or quantified but were used by department chairs to inform their commentary on teaching effectiveness in the PDR and/or to generate conversations about teaching. No results were submitted to Academic Affairs. The demand from administration during negotiations was that survey data needed to be submitted to Academic Affairs to assure that student voice was clearly a part of the process of evaluating faculty. Even though the negotiations went on for two years (2014 2016) with a one year contract agreed to for 2015 2016 before eventually agreeing to a four year contract for 2016 2020, pressure concerning student surveys of teaching was a recurring theme. To address this concern, union and college negotiators agreed to research the matter and make evidence based decisions to resolve the disagreement. At the time, Dr. Akins served on the negotiating team for the Full time Faculty and Staff 2016 2020 contract and Dr. Murphy served on the negotiating team for the Part time Faculty and Staff 2016 2020 contract. For the purpose of collecting research and formulating our arguments for negotiations, a joint subcommittee on Faculty Evaluations made up of members of both the full time and part time teams was formed. Both Akins and Murphy served on this sub committee and led the research effort. Research: Our study of the research on student surveys quickly led to an ever expanding body of scholarship indicating that student surveys do not reliably measure the quality of teaching. While student opinions about their educational experiences are important and valuable, numerous studies demonstrate that students are not qualified to judge teaching effectiveness. In addition, research indicates that survey results are influenced by the gender, race, ethnicity, and perceived attractiveness of the instructor. For example, Anne Boring, Kellie Ottoboni, and Philip B. Stark write that \"SET are biased against female instructors by an amount that is large and statistically significant,\" and \"gender biases can be large enough to cause more effective instructors to get lower SET than less effective instructors.\" Boring, Ottoboni, and Stark argue that \"it is not L.

Murphy, NCSCBHEP 2019 2 2 Journal of Collective Bargaining in the Academy, Vol. 0, Iss. 14 [2019] Art. 57 https:/thekeep.eiu.edu/jcba/vol0/iss14/57 possible to adjust for the bias, because it depends on so many factors.\" There is also evidence to 1 suggest that the academic rigor of a course, as well as a student's desire to take a course and how much prior knowledge student has about a subject impact survey results. Any implementation of 2 student surveys with low response rates, such as commonly occurs when surveys are delivered online, is statistically problematic, further distorting the data. 3 Based on our review of the available scholarship we concluded that our then present system of faculty evaluation utilized student surveys in a way that was best suited to provide faculty with the opportunity to gain what is valuable about student opinions expressed in surveys while minimizing damage to academic freedom and academic integrity, and minimizing discrimination against faculty who are rated lower on surveys for reasons that have nothing to do with their teaching effectiveness, or are even rated lower because they are effective teachers. A list of articles consulted for contract negotiations and subsequent Evaluation Committee work is provided at the end of this paper. Negotiations: As described in the previous section, for the purpose of negotiations we researched important questions about evaluations of teachers and the use of Student Evaluation of Teaching (SET) or, as we prefer to call it Student Surveys of Teaching (SST) This preferred name is what the form has been called historically at our campus and we believe \"survey\" better reflects its output. The negotiations process was based on an interest based bargaining (IBB) model without formal training for either side to assure we understood how to apply IBB principles fairly and equitably, which was a challenge to effective negotiations. Another challenge to effective negotiations was a silence agreement that limited our ability to mobilize faculty. Within this framework for discussion, however, there was agreement around the table that student voice had a role in evaluating the effectiveness of a faculty member. Our conflict was in the appropriate extent of that role and the process to include that voice as well as other relevant voices in the evaluation process. That conflict was not only with management but also with other faculty negotiators, which was further complicated by the silence agreement because it limited these discussions to a very small group of faculty. 1 Anne Boring, Kellie Ottoboni, and Philip B.

While we did a significant review of literature on the topic, as described above, the administration shared a limited number of articles which mostly focussed on outdated data and analysis or were crafted by organizations that benefit financially from \"quantifying\" student feedback.

The analysis shows that the majority of CS scholars tend to make their scholarly debut, publish more articles, and collaborate with more coauthors in conferences than in journals.

IINTRODUCTION Due to the increasing use of steel structures and the extended application of bolt connections, a careful examination of the connections performance in a steel structure is important, and inaccuracy in the design and implementation of connections not only causes failure in the joint, but also has devastating effects on other members of the structure. The beams and end plate set with embedded holes are connected to the column flange usig high strength bolts in the workshop. There are two types of beam column flange connections with named four bolts and eight bolts. The four bolt connection is used for lower moment values and the eight bolt connection for more bending moment values. In this research, the bending behavior of flange connection under increasing cyclic loading is evaluated by changing the effective parameters such as the end plate shape and the bolt material. For this purpose, several numerical models are prepared using finite element software and the extent of the effect of parameters on the flange connection behavior is determined. The main objective of this research is to investigate the bending behavior of end plate connection in steel structures under incremental cyclic loading by Impact Factor Value 5.856 e ISSN: 2456 3463 International Journal of Innovations in Engineering and Science, Vol 5, No.8, 2020 www.ijies.net 24 varying parameters affecting the connection behavior, such as bolt, the use of stiffener (gusset) continuity plate and double plate. To this end, stress distribution in the connection components is investigated by changing the parameters and changing the position of the plastic joint in the beam and the bending capacity of the connection and the connection behavior based on hysteresis and rotational capacity and energy depletion. The results of this research can help to better design the flange bending connection. This study evaluates the cyclic behavior of beam column flange connection in steel frames using finite element analysis. The ability to simulate the nonlinear behavior of the connection provides very high precision. In this connection, the steel beam is connected to the end plate using groove weld in flanges and groove or fillet weld in web with a suitable control. The set of beams and end plates in which holes are embedded, is attached to the column flange using high strength bolts. Types of rigid connections used in steel structures include: rigid welded flange plate connection, rigid connection with straight welding of beam to column, rigid flange plate connection with 4 and 8 bolts, rigid end plate flange connection, flush and extended end plate connections, with and without stiffener. In the flush end plate connection, the dimensions of the end plate do not exceed the beam flange, but the extended end plate connection, the dimensions of the end plate should exceed beam flange so that the bolt can be placed in the outer part of the plate. The extended end plate connections can be with or without hardening between the tensile flange of the beam and the end plate on the web plate, which is used rigid connection of beam to column. IIPREVIOUS RESEARCH Grundy et al. in 1980 [1] studied various parameters affecting the performance of flange connections. In their experiments, they measured three parameters, including the bolt diameter, the plate thickness and the column stiffener. Tsai and Popov in 1990 [2] tested three types of bending flange connection under a cyclic load using finite element analysis. The results show that the flange plate connections have excellent energy dissipation capacity. Hejazi and Mehdad in 2009 [3] investigated the effects of reinforcing plates on the flange connection of beam to the column using finite element analysis. In this research, 6 numerical models were modeled using Ansys software. Based on the results obtained, the use of stiffener, especially triangular plates, significantly increases the ductility, rigidity and load bearing capacity of flanged connections. Joshi and colleagues in 2014 [4] modeled rigid flange connections using Abaqus software. The results of this study showed that, with increasing bolt diameter, the bending bearing capacity of the connection increases, and also the failure mode is located on the column flange. Rajeshkumar et al. In 2013 [5] investigated the rigid flange connection under fire induced heat. The modeling was performed using Abaqus finite element software different end plate thicknesses were evaluated. According to the results of this study, the increase in plate thickness, although increasing the flexural strength of the joint, increases the force in bolts and increases the risk of brittle fracture in the bolts. Balc In 2012 [6] investigated the beam connection to welded and bolted columns using numerical models. In this study, two samples of welded and bolted flange plates were analyzed using the finite element method in Abaqus software and the results were evaluated using laboratory data. Baei et al. In 2012 [7] presented a finite element modeling approach for numerical verification of the seismic performance of a rigid connection with bolted end plate, taking into account axial force. The results of the research showed that the presence of axial force affects the connection performance, so that the presence of the tensile force reduces the final bending strength of the joint. Ismail et al. In 2016 [8] examined the final performance of the end plate steel connections. The results show that the non stiffening model with flush end plate has a much lower bending strength than other models, and with increasing stiffening angle, the bending strength of the connection also increases. Saberi et.al In 2014,2016 [9] have explored comparison of bolted end plate and T stub connection Sensivity to component thickness and bolt diameter on cyclic behavior. The result showed that The bolted T stub connections are more sensitive to component thickness and bolt diameter rather than end plate connections.Moreover, they proposed using of post tensioned tendons for rehabilitation of mentioned weak connections. Dessouki et al. In 2013 [10] investigated the bending behavior of Ibeam to end plate connection in 2013. In this research, Impact Factor Value 5.856 e ISSN: 2456 3463 International Journal of Innovations in Engineering and Science, Vol 5, No.8, 2020 www.ijies.net 25 Ansys software was used to analyze the parameters such as beam depth, plate thickness, bolt diameter, bolt thread, bolt strength and stiffness. Ghassemieh et al. In 2012 [11] used an artificial neural network supra innovative algorithm to optimize the stiffened bending flange connection. Chen and Shi in 2016 [12] performed a finite elemental study on end plate bending connection for very high bending strength. In order to study the seismic behavior of bending frames with flange connections, a precise and effective finite element model under cyclic loading was prepared by Wang and colleagues in 2013 [13] study the effect of retrofit parameters on cyclic behavior of bolted connections with weak end plate. The analytical study is about the cyclic behavior of bolted connections with weak end plate retrofitted by welded haunches, the accuracy of modeling is verified by comparing the finite element model result with the experimental test results two specimens EP R And EPWP H15 D30 that are tested by saberi et .al In 2017 [14] under SAC cyclic load Since end plate and beam are connected with complete joint penetration (CJP) groove and fillet welds, they are considered to be continuous in the FE model by Saberi et.al. In 2011 [15] Saedi Daryan et. al. in 2012 [16] to consider interaction in contact surfaces of the connection, tangential behavior is defined by friction coulomb's coefficient of 0.3 and hard contact normal behavior. A pretension stress of 550Mpa is applied to all bolts. In this research, both extended and flush flange connections were modeled and analyzed. IIIRESEARCH METHODOLOGY In this study, using nonlinear analyzes and finite element, several examples beam column bolt connections with endplate have been investigated. In this regard, static nonlinear analysis was performed using Abaqus software. With reliable modeling results from comparison of numerical and experimental results, effective parameters in the design of connections, such as the number of bolts and their placement, as well as the presence of stiffening agents, were investigated.

This adjustment is nowadays routinely performed so as to benefit of the latest improvements of convolutional neural networks trained on large databases. Fine tuning requires some form of regularization, which is typically implemented by weight decay that drives the network parameters towards zero. This choice conflicts with the motivation for fine tuning, as starting from a pre trained solution aims at taking advantage of the previously acquired knowledge. Hence, regularizers promoting an explicit inductive bias towards the pre trained model have been recently proposed. This paper demonstrates the versatility of this type of regularizer across transfer learning scenarios. We replicated experiments on three state of the art approaches in image classification, image segmentation, and video analysis to compare the relative merits of regularizers. These tests show systematic improvements compared to weight decay.

Specifically, by exploiting the connection between the backward propagation of GNNs and random walks, we show that the common gradient based white box attacks can be generalized to the black box setting via the connection between the gradient and an importance score similar to PageRank. In practice, we find attacks based on this importance score indeed increase the classification loss by a large margin, but they fail to significantly increase the mis classification rate. Our theoretical and empirical analyses suggest that there is a discrepancy between the loss and mis classification rate, as the latter presents a diminishing return pattern when the number of attacked nodes increases.

As a result, various online communities are formed, ranging from online social networks (Facebook, Twitter) to mobile communities (Foursquare, Waze) to content/interests based networks (Wikipedia, Yelp, Quora) While users are benefiting from the ease of access to information and social interactions, there is a growing concern for users' security and privacy against various attacks such as spam, phishing, malware infection and identity theft. Combating attacks and abuse in online communities is challenging. First, today's online communities are increasingly dependent on users and user generated content. Securing online systems demands a deep understanding of the complex and often unpredictable human behaviors. Second, online communities can easily have millions or even billions of users, which requires the corresponding security mechanisms to be highly scalable. Finally, cybercriminals are constantly evolving to launch new types of attacks. This further demands high robustness of security defenses. In this thesis, we take concrete steps towards measuring, understanding, and defending against attacks and abuse in online communities. We begin with a series of empirical measurements to understand user behaviors in different online services and the uniquesecurity and privacy challenges that users are facing with. This effort covers a broad set of popular online services including social networks for question and answering (Quora) anonymous social networks (Whisper) and crowdsourced mobile communities (Waze) Despite the differences of specific online communities, our study provides a first look at their user activity patterns based on empirical data, and reveals the need for reliable mechanisms to curate user content, protect privacy, and defend against emerging attacks. Next, we turn our attention to attacks targeting online communities, with focus on spam campaigns. While traditional spam is mostly generated by automated software, attackers today start to introduce \"human intelligence\" to implement attacks. This is maliciouscrowdsourcing (or crowdturfing) where a large group of real users are organized to carry out malicious campaigns, such as writing fake reviews or spreading rumors on social media. Using collective human efforts, attackers can easily bypass many existing defenses (e.g.,CAPTCHA) To understand the ecosystem of crowdturfing, we first use measurements to examine their detailed campaign organization, workers and revenue. Based on insights from empirical data, we develop effective machine learning classifiers to detect crowdturfingactivities. In the meantime, considering the adversarial nature of crowdturfing, we also build practical adversarial models to simulate how attackers can evade or disrupt machine learning based defenses. To aid in this effort, we next explore using user behavior models to detect a wider range of attacks. Instead of making assumptions about attacker behavior, our idea is to model normal user behaviors and capture (malicious) behaviors that are deviated from norm. In this way, we can detect previously unknown attacks. Our behavior model is based on detailed clickstream data, which are sequences of click events generated by users when using the service. We build a similarity graph where each user is a node and the edges are weightedby clickstream similarity. By partitioning this graph, we obtain \"clusters\" of users with similar behaviors. We then use a small set of known good users to \"color\" these clusters to differentiate the malicious ones. This technique has been adopted by real world social networks (Renren and LinkedIn) and already detected unexpected attacks. Finally, we extend clickstream model to understanding more grained behaviors of attackers (and real users) and tracking how user behavior changes over time. In summary, this thesis illustrates a data driven approach to understanding and defending against attacks and abuse in online communities. Our measurements have revealed new insights about how attackers are evolving to bypass existing security defenses today. Inaddition, our data driven systems provide new solutions for online services to gain a deep understanding of their users, and defend them from emerging attacks and abuse.", "venue": "", "year": 2016.0, "author_names": ["Gang Wang"], "n_citations": 2, "n_key_citations": 0, "score": 0}]}

Invisible Engines examines the business dynamics and strategies used by firms that recognize the transformative power unleashed by this new revolutiona revolution that will change both new and old industries. The authors argue that in order to understand the successes of software platforms, we must first understand their role as a technological meeting ground where application developers and end users converge.

More applications attract more users, and more users attract more applications. And more applications and more users lead to more profits. Invisible Engines explores this story through the lens of the companies that have mastered this platform balancing act.

Many of these post approval changes require regulatory agency approval by individual countries before implementation. Because of the global regulatory complexity, individual post approval changes usually take years for full worldwide approval even when they reduce patient risk, improve compliance, or enhance the manufacturing process or test methods. This global complexity slows down continual improvement and innovation and can cause drug shortages and current good manufacturing practices compliance issues. Manufacturers that market products globally experience the greatest challenge and risks in their daily operations because of this post approval change complexity. A global problem needs a global solution. Quality leaders speaking globally with \"One Voice of Quality\" are essential for solving this difficult problem. This concept paper has been developed under the sponsorship of a group of Chief Quality Officers (Heads of Quality) from >25 global pharmaceutical companies and has been endorsed by the Parenteral Drug Association. The intent of this concept paper is to develop and implement aligned, standard solutions within the industry, leveraging the core foundation of the pharmaceutical quality system, such that a transformational shift can be achieved with faster implementation of new knowledge, continual improvement, and innovation through post approval changes. LAY ABSTRACT: Pharmaceutical manufacturers must make changes to their products and manufacturing processes over time as they incorporate new technology and new information. Because drug products are highly regulated in every country, the manufacturer must often contact national drug regulators before making these changes, even if the manufacturer is confident, based on testing and process controls, that the change will not have a negative impact on product quality or patient safety. For a product that is globally marketed, the manufacturer may have to contact dozens of regulators before making a change. This paper suggests that industry work together to identify ways to demonstrate to regulators that product and process knowledge as well as pharmaceutical quality systems are strong enough that the manufacturers should be allowed to manage some post approval changes themselves.", "venue": "PDA Journal of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology", "year": 2019.0, "author_names": ["Anders Lerbech Vinther", "Emma Ramnarine"], "n_citations": 4, "n_key_citations": 0, "score": 0}, {"corpus_id": 214799071, "title": "Recent Trends in Innovation and Business Models in the New Digital Economy", "abstract": "In this paper, we present a model that shows how the new innovation environment defined by co creation experiments within a value chain and supported by e networks connecting suppliers, partners and customers at world level is changing business models. Due to the ongoing convergence of products, industries and technologies at world level, innovation capacity is rapidly improving. To succeed in this new environment for innovation, multinationals will have to rely on an \"ecosystem\" (M.Iansiti and R.Levien, 2004) made of external competencies and bear on all participants in the value chain from customers to suppliers, partners and universities R&D departments. CONVERGENCE OF PRODUCTS, TECHNOLOGIES AND INDUSTRIES AS THE SOURCE OF NEW WAYS FOR GENERATING INNOVATION The convergence of technologies, industries and markets is transforming the process and even the meaning of innovation (Prahald and Romaswamy, 2003) The digital era is remodelling the industries boundaries and even the frontiers of products and services. Before the Internet revolution, education, communication and leisure markets for example, used to be linked to very specific industries such as electronic (including TV, audio and video products) computer (PCs, laptops and video consoles) communication devices (phones, pages) software, movies and music industries (Prahald and Romaswamy, 2003) Each industry had well defined competitors. A computer was different from a mobile phone, and a mobile phone was different from a music player. As the digital economy unfolds, the frontiers between computers, mobile devices, video cameras, and music players tend to disappear. A mobile phone is no more a mobile communication tool, but is used as an Internet access and music download device. Diagram 1. New trends in market innovation: main components New technologies and the ability to bundle services on competing infrastructures, are driving this convergence and transforming many industries. The digital technology is eroding the traditional space of products and reshaping the solution space into an experience space including new ways of creating value and generating innovation. The product space is defined by the traditional way of innovating and producing goods and services (technological features generated by the firm and its base of suppliers) whereas the solution space is characterized by the recent trend of bundling sets of interconnected products and services to customers. On the other hand, networks effects and customers' communities form the new emerging experience space. Moreover, innovation includes changes not only in the products technology or features, but also encompasses changes in processes, organizations or business models. Furthermore, disrupting factors in any competitive landscape, due to deregulation, opening of borders and new customers' behaviour or new commercial channels, naturally lead to the new experience space involving more and more stakeholders. The model depicted in diagram 1 illustrates these new trends. THE NEED OF FLEXIBILITY, MASS CUSTOMISATION AND RESPONSIVENESS Companies are currently facing the strategic challenge of improving their customer relationship management as on line technology makes it possible to customize products and also makes both individual and business customers much more informed than they were not so long ago about prices, quality and other dimensions of goods and services. As a consequence, to survive, businesses can no longer keep the customers outside their core innovation process. Thus, customer retention and strategic competitiveness required redefining business models based on a close relationship with the customers to make them active partners within the innovation and marketing process. THE CO CREATION OF VALUE Information based economy has encouraged the trend of coo petition between all the industries. Competitors work in a network of shared resources and competencies for a better performance. Information networks are including competitors, who behave as co operators in a coproduction and co innovation process (B. Chakravorti, 2004 and C.K Prahald and V. Ramaswamy, 2003) As markets are more and more global, co creation of value through customized experiences is becoming the new opportunity space. Firms will rely on a locus of competencies including partners and customers, far beyond internal and suppliers' frontiers base. The innovation process is no more the strategic competency of large companies, but tends to be developed by e value added chains including small to medium suppliers. As there are less and less geographic constraints, new relations of alliances of all sorts are shaping complex co production constellations of actors.

Specifically, we develop a framework based on two novel concepts (1) digital business innovation (DBI) platforms; and (2) digital business innovation capability at the ecosystem level of analysis. First, we describe DBI platform through three properties scale, scope and speed. Second, we describe DBI ecosystem capability using three dimensions operational, dynamic and improvisational capabilities. The DBI platform and capabilities together give rise to business value that are created at the level of the ecosystem and shared by the various co contributors. We generate a set of theoretical propositions by bringing the role of information and technology as drivers of value creation and capture in ecosystems. While extant research on IT and innovation has focused on the individual, organizational, and rarely at the inter organizational level of analysis, this paper argues for the importance of innovation ecosystems, which are complex, interdependent, and constantly evolving. We support our conceptual framework and propositions with a case example of digital business innovations with digital technologies underway in the automotive sector. We conclude with a set of critical issues for further development of theory on DBI platforms and ecosystem capabilities that are disrupting and transforming firms, industries, and markets. Our belief is that IS research could make important contributions to the broader innovation literature by explicating how information and technology individually and in tandem give rise to business value co created in ecosystems and shared by the various co contributors in the ecosystem.

Without role clarity, peers may struggle to find their place. Pairing new staff with mentors may limit this burden. As roles consolidate, boundaries may emerge.

From those eligible, a random number generator was used to select participants who would be interviewed using a semi structured interview guide. The critical incident technique was used to elicit memorable experiences of supervision. Data was analyzed thematically. Twenty interviews were completed before saturation was reached. Thematic analysis revealed eight major themes which are best understood in the context of the ongoing transformation of mental health services from the traditional medical model to a recovery oriented model. Those eight themes were supervisor attitudes, role integration, trauma informed supervisory techniques, facilitative/supportive environment, perspective taking, mutual learning, opportunities for peer networking and the desire for a supervisor who was a more experienced peer support worker. The supervisor's attitude was a critical factor in providing what PSS perceived as adequate supervision. An attitude of respect for the peer role combined synergistically with positive nonjudgmental communication to create a facilitative/supportive environment. That environment supported autonomous functioning which in turn worked to address role integration and suggest trauma informed supervisory techniques.

The experiences of PSS reflect the challenges inherent in role THE EXPERIENCES OF PEER SUPPORT SPECIALISTS SUPERVISED 10 innovation. NPS are the necessary guides who assist the PSS in navigating a system not yet aligned with peer values. If the mental health system is going to successfully become recovery oriented, then NPS need a unique skill set to support those with lived experience whose recovery can help point the way. THE EXPERIENCES OF PEER SUPPORT SPECIALISTS SUPERVISED 11 Chapter I BACKGROUND In the past few years, peer support has become part of the mental health landscape (Cronise, Teixeira, Rogers, Harrington, 2016; Salzer, Schwenk, Brusilovsky, 2010) In step with the empowerment education movement, which sought to redefine the relationship of patients and healthcare providers, health systems began moving towards a system of care that included the patient as an active participant (Anderson Funnell, 2004; Wallerstein Bernstein, 1988; Wallerstein Bernstein, 1994) In a similar fashion, the location of peer support has migrated from its initial location in self help groups to free standing peer run agencies to peer agencies working alongside traditional mental health agencies and ultimately, in the last decade, a move towards integration of peers into both health and mental health systems. Evolution of Peer Support Peer support is generally defined as a way of giving and receiving help from people who have similar experiences (Davidson, Bellamy, Guy, Miller, 2012; Lammers Happell, 2003; Mead, 2003; President's New Freedom Commission, 2003; Repper Carter, 2011) More specifically, peer support is defined as a way of giving and receiving help from people who have similar experiences based on key principles of respect, shared responsibility and mutual agreement about what is helpful (Davidson, Bellamy, Guy, Miller, 2013; Lammers Happell, 2003; Mead, 2003; President's New Freedom Commission, 2003; Repper Carter, 2010) Peer support in mental health has evolved. Originally peer support was located within self help groups and later within THE EXPERIENCES OF PEER SUPPORT SPECIALISTS SUPERVISED 12 peer run agencies. Now, peers provide peer support in a variety of settings from independent peer agencies to case management teams to inclusion in more traditional settings like partial hospitalization programs, clubhouses and drop in centers (Salzer et al. 2010) The evolution has also been reflected in how peers refer to themselves. For example, early literature referred to such individuals as psychiatric survivors, a term connoting the low regard many had for the mental health system where they were treated (Chamberlin, 1978; Chamberlin, 1990) The moniker shifted to consumers and then to peers. Likewise, there has been a change in how peers who provide support for other peers refer to themselves. Titles have shifted from peer advocate, peer supporter, peer provider, peer support specialist, certified peer specialist and most recently to peer professional. For the purposes of this study, the term peer support specialist (PSS) will be used as it is a term commonly used as a job title for peers hired to support others with a mental health diagnosis. It is widely accepted that peer support is a critical element of a recovery oriented system of care (Anthony, 1993; Deegan, 1988; Lunt, 2002; President's New Freedom Commission, 2003; Ralph, 2000) Research suggests efforts to integrate into this disparate system of care bring both barriers and challenges. Given that PSS who are credentialed by their lived experience work among other professionals who are credentialed by their educational experience (Gates, Mandiberg, Akabas, 2010; Bennetts, Pinches, Paluch, Fossey, 2013; Budd, 1987; Chesler, 1990; Gartner Riesman, 1982; Kemp Henderson, 2012; Repper Carter, 2010; Smith et al. 2016; Vandewalle et al. 2016) Much of the current literature studying barriers and challenges THE EXPERIENCES OF PEER SUPPORT SPECIALISTS SUPERVISED 13 to integration suggests that supervision is a key component of successful integration. There is little known about the supervision of PSS in general or about PSS supervision by non peer professionals. There is currently no empirical literature which addresses the experiences of PSS receiving supervision. Data suggests that the trend of peers working as PSS alongside non peer mental health professionals continues to grow (Chapman, Blash, Chan, 2015) Given this trend, there is a need to understand whether supervision by a non peer meets the supervisory needs of a PSS when integrating into a clinical adult mental health team (Middleton, Stanton, Renouf, 2004) In this chapter, the history leading to the current mental health landscape, the empirical studies of peer support, differences in peer and professional perspectives, and establishment of what is currently understood about the challenges of peer integration will be presented. Additionally, the framework of clinical supervision and a 2015 report titled the Pillars of Peer Supervision (Daniels, Tunner, Powell, Fricks, Ashenden, 2015) are employed as ways of understanding the supervision of peers by non peer supervisors (NPS) Finally, the use of a qualitative research design is suggested as the methodology best suited to understand situations or experiences about which little is known, such as the non peer supervision of PSS (Creswell, 2013) If peer support is to provide an efficacious service element for persons with serious mental illness, we must understand more about what supports its success and how supervision can contribute. The Role of Recovery in the Historical Context The mental health recovery paradigm has become a significant philosophical influence on the delivery of mental health services; however, the use of the term recovery THE EXPERIENCES OF PEER SUPPORT SPECIALISTS SUPERVISED 14 has varied widely. As the possibility of recovery was introduced into mental health systems through the writings of proponents and through documents such as the President's New Freedom Commission (2003) mental health service providers slowly began to incorporate the language and tools of recovery into mental health settings. The term recovery is used differently in different settings. For some mental health practitioners, the term may refer to expected clinical outcomes or for other practitioners, it may refer to a philosophy or attitude that casts doubt about viewing all serious mental illness as a chronic condition (Anthony, 1993; Deegan, 1988; Harding, Brooks, Ashikaga, Strauss, Brieier, 1987) The concept of clinical recovery implies that a person is experiencing no signs or symptoms of mental illness, living independently, having a social life and working. In short, the individual is considered disease free. The philosophy of personal recovery as noted by Deegan (1988) and Anthony (1993) generally refers to a process whereby a person develops a new sense of self that encompasses the presence of mental illness and continues with their life. In essence, the mental illness becomes a long term condition that must be dealt with but which does not define the individual. Recovery in the substance abuse field, for example, generally reflects a philosophical stance suggesting acceptance of abstinence from addictive substances as a goal which is achieved one day at a time (White, 2007) In this study, we will refer to recovery as personal recovery, that is the ability to live a satisfying and contributing life irrespective of ongoing symptoms and disability which is the philosophical understanding promoted by Deegan (1988) and Anthony (1993) THE EXPERIENCES OF PEER SUPPORT SPECIALISTS SUPERVISED 15 Until longitudinal studies such as those conducted by Harding, Brooks, Ashikaga, Strauss, and Brieier (1987a) clinical recovery was generally not considered a likely outcome for individuals with serious mental illness. This prognostic conception of serious mental illness was likely reinforced by the seemingly chronic nature of the individuals in treatment facilities. This misconception was best explained by Cohen and Cohen's, The Clinician's Illusion (1984) Essentially, clinicians do not see persons who clinically recover from severe mental illness since they no lo", "venue": "", "year": 2020.0, "author_names": ["Joan Forbes"], "n_citations": 0, "n_key_citations": 0, "score": 0}]}

However, for the realization of these applications, effective motion control algorithms need to be developed. These motion control algorithms require mathematical representation of AUV which comprises of hydrodynamic damping, Coriolis terms, mass and inertia terms etc. To obtain dynamics of an AUV, different analytical and empirical methods are reported in the literature such as tow tank test, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis and on line system identification. Among these methods, tow tank test and CFD analysis provide white box identified model of the AUV dynamics. Thus, the control design using these methods are found to be ineffective in situation of change in payloads of an AUV or parametric variations in AUV dynamics. On the other hand, control design using on line identification, the dynamics of AUV can be obtained at every sampling time and thus the aforesaid parametric variations in AUV dynamics can be handled effectively. In this thesis, adaptive control strategies are developed using the parameters of AUV obtained through on line system identification. The proposed algorithms are verified first through simulation and then through experimentation on the prototype AUV. Among various motion control algorithms, waypoint tracking has more practical significance for oceanographic surveys and many other applications. In order to implement, waypoint motion control schemes, Line of Sight (LoS) guidance law can be used which is computationally less expensive. In this thesis, adaptive control schemes are developed to implement LoS guidance for an AUV for practical realization of the control algorithm. Further, in order to realize the proposed control algorithms, a prototype AUV is developed in the laboratory. The developed AUV is a torpedo shaped in order to experience low drag force, underactuated AUV with a single thruster for forward motion and control planes for angular motion. Firstly, the AUV structure such as nose profile, tail profile, hull section and control planes are designed and developed. Secondly, the hardware configuration of the AUV such as sensors, actuators, computational unit, communication module etc. are appropriately selected. Finally, a software framework called Robot Operating System (ROS) is used for seamless integration of various sensors, actuators with the computational unit. ROS is a software platform which provides right platform for the implementation of the control algorithms using the sensor data to achieve autonomous capability of the AUV. In order to develop adaptive control strategies, the unknown dynamics of the AUV is identified using polynomial based Nonlinear Autoregressive Moving Average eXogenous (NARMAX) model structure. The parameters of this NARMAX model structure are identified online using Recursive Extended Least Square (RELS) method. Then an adaptive controller is developed for realization of the LoS guidance law for an AUV. Using the kinematic equation and the desired path parameters, a Lyapunov based backstepping controller is designed to obtain the reference velocities for the dynamics. Subsequently, a self tuning PID controller is designed for the AUV to track these reference velocities. Using an inverse optimal control technique, the gains of the selftuning PID controller are tuned on line. Although, this algorithm is computationally less expensive but there lie issues such as actuator constraints and state constraints which need to be resolved in view of practical realization of the control law. It is also observed that the proposed NARMAX structure of the AUV consists of redundant regressor terms. To alleviate the aforesaid limitations of the Inverse optimal self tuning control scheme, a constrained adaptive control scheme is proposed that employs a minimum representation of the NARMAX structure (MR NARMAX) for capturing AUV dynamics. The regressors of the MR NARMAX structure are identified using Forward Regressor Orthogonal Least Square algorithm. Further, the parameters of this MRNARMAX model structure of the AUV are identified at every sampling time using RELS algorithm. Using the desired path parameters and the identified dynamics, an error objective function is defined which is to be minimized. The minimization problem where the objective function with the state and actuator constraints is formulated as a convex optimization problem. This optimization problem is solved using quadratic programming technique. The proposed MR NARMAX based adaptive control is verified in the simulation and then on the prototype AUV. From the obtained results it is observed that this algorithm provides successful tracking of the desired heading. But, the proposed control algorithm is computational expensive, as an optimization problem is to be solved at each sampling instant. In order to reduce the computational time, an explicit model predictive control strategy is developed using the concept of multi parametric programming. A Lyapunov based backstepping controller is designed to generate desired yaw velocity in order to steer the AUV towards the desired path. This explicit model predictive controller is designed using the identified NARMAX model for tracking the desired yaw velocity. The proposed explicit MPC algorithm is implemented first in simulation and then in the prototype AUV. From the simulation and experimental results, it is found that this controller has less computation time and also it considers both the state and actuator constraints whilst exhibiting good tracking performance.", "venue": "", "year": 2016.0, "author_names": ["R Rout"], "n_citations": 0, "n_key_citations": 0, "score": 0}, {"corpus_id": 199392510, "title": "THE UNDERWATER TOWED SYSTEM BEHAVIOR DURING SHIP TURNING MANEUVERS", "abstract": "The depth and attitude of underwater towed system show complex behavior during the towing ship turning maneuvers.

However, the evolutionary and biomedical features of these hotspots remain incompletely understood. Here, we analyzed data from 2,504 genomes to construct a refined map of 1,148 SV hotspots in human genomes. We confirmed that segmental duplication related nonallelic homologous recombination is an important mechanistic driver of SV hotspot formation. However, to our surprise, we also found that a majority of SVs in hotspots do not form through such recombination based mechanisms, suggesting diverse mechanistic and selective forces shaping hotspots. Indeed, our evolutionary analyses showed that the majority of SV hotspots are within gene poor regions and evolve under relaxed negative selection or neutrality. However, we still found a small subset of SV hotspots harboring genes that are enriched for anthropologically crucial functions and evolve under geography specific and balancing adaptive forces. These include two independent hotspots on different chromosomes affecting alpha and beta hemoglobin gene clusters. Biomedically, we found that the SV hotspots coincide with breakpoints of clinically relevant, large de novo SVs, significantly more often than genome wide expectations.

In this study, we analyzed data from 2,504 genomes from the 1000 Genomes Project Consortium and constructed a refined map of 1,148 SV hotspots in human genomes. By studying the genomic architecture of these hotspots, we found that both nonallelic homologous recombination and non homologous mechanisms act as mechanistic drivers of SV formation. We found that the majority of SV hotspots are within gene poor regions and evolve under relaxed negative selection or neutrality. However, we found that a small subset of SV hotspots harbor genes that are enriched for anthropologically crucial functions, including blood oxygen transport, olfaction, synapse assembly, and antigen binding. We provide evidence that balancing selection may have maintained these SV hotspots, which include two independent hotspots on different chromosomes affecting alpha and beta hemoglobin gene clusters.

Migration also causes multiple DNA repair proteins to segregate away from DNA, with cytoplasmic mis localization sustained for many hours as is relevant to delayed repair. Partial knockdown of repair factors that also regulate chromosome copy numbers is seen to increase DNA breaks in U2OS osteosarcoma cells without affecting migration and with nucleoplasmic patterns of damage similar to constricted migration.

Satisfying these key factors were normally achieved by proper internal confinement of R.C. columns using the traditional tie \"transverse\" reinforcement. Recently, internal confinement using short steel fibers or a cage of wire mesh [1 and 2] and external confinement using wire mesh imbedded in mortar (ferrocement) or wraps of advanced composite sheets [3 and 4] greatly improved the performance of R.C columns, in buildings under gravity or seismic loads. Harajli and Rteil [1] reported that internal confinement using steel fibers in the columns improved performance similar to external confinement with carbon fiber sheets. Razvi and Saatcioglu [2] Furlong et al. [5] Mau et al. [6] and Aikhionbare and Tabsh [7] found that the columns internally confined by welded wire fabric inside or outside the transverse ties showed a significant improvement in strength and ductility compared with those designed according to ACI Building Code [8] with closely spaced ties and longitudinal reinforcement only. Saatcioglu and Grira [9] found that welded grids offer an economic alternative to conventional ties with reduced construction time, especially for earthquake resistant construction where the tie details may be prohibitively complex. Fahmy et al [3] studied the external wrapping of ferrocement laminates in repairing of reinforced concrete. It was found that the results of all repaired specimens demonstrated better behavior and load carrying capacity compared to their original behavior. Saadatmanesh [4] found that the stress strain models for concrete confined with composite straps indicate significant increases in compressive strength and strain at failure when compared with the stress strain behavior of unconfined concrete. Naguib and Mirmiran [10] studied the effect of lateral confinement on the behavior of the concrete columns. Harajli and Rteil [1] studied the seismic performance of concrete columns reinforced with ordinary transverse steel and those confined externally with carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) sheets. They found that confinement with the traditional transverse steel enhanced the seismic behavior and increased the energy absorption capacities of the columns but not as effective as confinement externally with CFRP. The different techniques for internal or external confinement of R.C columns are affected by the elevated temperature to different degrees. Poon and Lam [11] reported that the addition of steel fibers (internal confinement) is more effective in minimizing the degradation of compressive strength for the concrete after exposure to the elevated temperatures compared to traditional reinforcement using transverse ties only. In addition, steel fiber reinforced concretes showed the highest energy absorption capacity after the high temperature exposure, although they suffered a quick loss of this capacity. Very little information is available for the effect of fire resistance on the wire mesh used as additional reinforcement in R. C. columns. However, it was reported that expanded metal reinforcement is better than welded wire reinforcement in fire resistance because the welds at the wire junctions melt at a temperature much smaller than that of steel wires [12] ACI committee 549R 97 [12] stated the potentially poor fire resistance of ferrocement sections because of the inherent thinness of its structural forms and the abnormally low cover to the reinforcement. This is also applicable for the use of ferrocement as external confining tool. However, Naaman [13] proofed that ferrocement compares very favorably with GFRP when exposed to fire. Bisby et al. [14] reported that although the structural effectiveness of FRP materials can be maintained during fire, the fire behavior of FRP wrapped columns can be dramatically improved by providing supplemental insulation for the FRP. The objective of this research is firstly to evaluate the different methods used in confining square R.C columns, internally using expanded metal mesh or steel fibers, and externally using ferrocement laminates or GFRP, in improving the behavior of concrete columns compared with traditional reinforcement with transverse ties. Secondly, the effect of fire on the performance of the confining methods was conducted using the ready package computer program \"ANSYS 5.4\" [15] EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM Test Specimens Six R. C columns were prepared, namely, the control column reinforced traditionally with transverse ties only, two columns containing 1% and 2% steel fibers, one column reinforced additionally with a cage of expanded steel mesh (ESM) two columns wrapped with either ferrocement laminates or glass fiber reinforced plastics (GFRP) (see Figure 1) The columns were tested under axial loads concerning both strength and behavior to evaluate the effect of the different confining methods on the ultimate capacity and ductility. All columns were square in shape of height \"h\" 100 cm and width \"b\" 15 cm in order to achieve height to width ratio \" h/b\" 6.6 to avoid buckling. The details of the tested specimens are listed in Table 1. Materials and Mix Design All concrete constituents used conformed to the relevant Egyptian Standard Specifications [16] Sand and coarse aggregate (basalt) used were from a local pit. Two different size distributions of the basalt (14 and 5mm) were blended to obtain a uniform distribution. A superplasticizer based on polynaphthalene sulphate was used to improve the workability of the concrete mix. The actual cube compressive strengths for different specimens are given in Table 1. Table 2 provides the mix proportions. The steel used for the longitudinal reinforcement consisted of four 10 mm diameter high grade steel (reinforcement ratio of 2.8% The characteristic yield strength for steel used was 360 MPa. Column tie reinforcement was fabricated from 6 mm mild steel round bars, spaced at 20 cm, of characteristic yield strength 240 MPa. Hooked end steel fibers of varying amounts, having yield strength of 400 MPa, were added in the mixes of columns with steel fibers. The aspect ratio of fibers was constant (Lf Df 60 mm /1 mm 60) Expanded steel mesh (ESM) used in this investigation was expanded metal lath conforming to ACI Committee 549, 1R 88 [17] The mesh has a diamond shape of wire diameter equals 1.5 mm and the yield strength was considered 260 MPa [17] For columns wrapped with GFRP, unidirectional E glass composite (resin fiber) tapes were used to wrap concrete columns. The properties of GFRP used were given by the manufacturer as follows; tensile strength =1103 MPa and modulus of elasticity 48.2 Gpa. Preparation of the Test Specimens All the column specimens including the control specimen, C1, were reinforced with four corner bars of diameter 10 mm as longitudinal reinforcement and transverse ties of 6 mm diameter spaced at 20 cm along the column. Electrical strain gauges were fixed on the longitudinal reinforcement to record the strains. For column specimens, C2 and C3, hooked end steel fibers of volume content 1 and 2% respectively, (see Table 1) were added during mixing of concrete. Column specimen, C4, was additionally reinforced by a cage of ESM of volume fraction, vf 2.2% in the core inside the transverse ties. Column specimens, C5 and C6, were wrapped after casting and curing with one layer of ferrocement (a cage of ESM imbedded in mortar around the column) or a layer of GFRP imbedded in a resin, respectively.", "venue": "", "year": 2005.0, "author_names": ["Hanaa I El-Sayad", "A A Shaheen"], "n_citations": 2, "n_key_citations": 1, "score": 0}, {"corpus_id": 55737824, "title": "RESPONSE OF REPAIRED FUSE BEAMS TO DYNAMIC TESTING", "abstract": "Controlled energy distribution is desirable for structures subjected to severe earthquakes.

Unlike common steel structures, innovative types of seismic resistant steel frames have been proposed, with dissipative fuses, where only damage will occur. Fuses are designed to be easily replaced. They usually consist of steel hollow sections. In the present paper, used hollow beams, that had suffered strength degradation of more than 50% were filled with cement based repair mortar (fcd =35 MPa) forming concrete filled composite beams (CFCBs) and were retested, without any other kind of repair. CFCBs are reported to have demonstrated higher axial load capacity, better ductility performance, larger energy absorption capacity and lower strength degradation than conventional reinforced concrete and steel hollow section columns. This became apparent by the results or the tests achieved by the experiments; bearing capacity of fuse beam was practically restored to its initial value when the damaged side of the initial beam was subjected to tension, while it increased to about 2.5 times its initial value, when the damaged side is subjected to compression. Increase of energy dissipation per loading cycle was also remarkable (increase about 150% Calculation of the stiffness of the fuse beam is performed, as it varies with the imposed displacement. Its effect on the eigenperiod of the main structure is discussed. The deformation limits that the cement based repair mortar has reached are calculated.

He foresaw the development of personal computers at a time when computers were huge, unwieldy machines available only to institutions. He anticipated the wide ranging effects of the Internet.

Some Chinese students, non Chinese students and all of the lecturers at the lectures in my corpus, commented on selected REs in interviews and group discussions. Analysis of the REs was informed by interactional sociolinguistic and pragmatic theories. Major formal, semantic, and functional properties of humour in the lectures were identified. Humour arose from the incongruous interplay between these properties. The lecturers used humour to carry out teaching tasks and interpersonal activities. Humour heightened the lecturers' stances toward their topics. These stances embodied sociocultural values. The Chinese students had evident problems comprehending their lecturers' humour. Some expressed a feeling of alienation at having to laugh with other classmates without understanding the cause. The lecturers were often unaware of the Chinese students' perceptions of their humour, and sometimes appeared to be insensitive to their negative feelings. Expression of stance in the humour was particularly problematic to the Chinese students, but they tended to consider it peripheral to the main purpose of their studies.

This paper describes the planning and evaluation of a multi professional, full scale simulation based course for hospital professionals. METHODS A systematic approach to course development was used and the programme was introduced on four general wards in a university hospital. Experts from the wards were trained as educators and participated in the course development. A needs assessment consisting of an observational study, questionnaires and interviews resulted in the creation of learning objectives to provide the road map for content and teaching methods. A 1 day multi professional ward specific educational programme with full scale simulations, mini lectures, case discussions and practical training was planned. Course material, a manual for educators and questionnaires for evaluation of the course were developed. RESULTS A 1 day full scale simulation based educational programme was developed and 50% of the medical staff and 70% of the nursing staff on four wards were trained in a 5 month period. The course was highly rated in terms of content and teaching methods. DISCUSSION The systematic approach for developing the course resulted in a relevant, highly rated course, deeply rooted in the wards, implying the opportunity to facilitate local improvements and adjust the content to local needs.

A response to Macnamara and Hambrick (2020)", "abstract": "In their commentary, Macnamara and Hambrick (Psychol Res, 2017) accused my colleagues and me of systematically changing the definition of the concept of deliberate practice. Deliberate practice was the result of a search for characteristics of effective practice in the laboratory that was shown to improve expert professional performance in domains, such as music. In this reply, I will first describe five different criteria that defined the original concept of deliberate practice and each of them is presented with directly supporting quotes from Ericsson, Krampe, and Tesch Romer (Psychol Rev 100:396 406, 10.1037/0033 295X.87.3.215, 1993) paper. Unfortunately, Macnamara, Hambrick, and Oswald (Psychol Sci 25:1608 1618, 10.1177/0956797614535810, 2014) misinterpreted our concept of deliberate practice, and defined it much more broadly: \"as engagement in structured activities created specifically to improve performance in a domain\" (p. 914) This definition led them to include activities, such as attending lectures, studying alone by students, and group activities led by a coach, where each activity does not meet one or more of our criteria for deliberate practice. In this commentary, I will argue that Macnamara and Hambrick (2020) became aware of some of the original criteria for deliberate practice, such as the role of individualized training by a teacher, and these discoveries misled them to assume that we had changed our definition. The intended meaning of sentences that Macnamara and Hambrick (2020) had carefully selected is shown to have an appropriate interpretation in Standard English that is consistent with our original definition of deliberate practice.

These are people who think about brains and minds professionally. Although this is a book about the philosophy of mind, it is also interdisciplinary, so I have made use not only of philosophers, but also of neuropsychologists and neuroscientists, people who have gained their understanding of how brain and behavior and mental experience go together through experimentation. I've borrowed from people in person in a series of interviews, many of which have been published in the Journal of Consciousness Studies. I've borrowed by means of e mail exchanges that I've had with numerous people over the past several years. And of course, I've borrowed from books. This book includes interviews, but is not strictly a collection of interviews. I have mixed in explanations and descriptions that are meant to clarify and explicate the issues under discussion. More specifically, this book is intended to be an unorthodox but very accessible introduction to certain themes that cut across the philosophy of mind and psychology. This might rightfully seem a contradiction. An introduction to a certain subject matter is supposed to be orthodox, if nothing else. That is, if one intends to introduce someone to a subject matter, one normally intends to review the established and received views that define the field. So in what sense can this be at the same time an introduction and unorthodox? Well first, the genre of this book is not standard for introductory textbooks since it consists in large parts of interviews rather than straight explanatory discourses. In addition, I can honestly say that there was no preconceived plan to the book, although this does not mean that a plan did not emerge in its construction. The topics and themes that we cover have emerged from the interviews themselves. But this is also why this can be considered an introductory text. The interview style, I believe, makes the various topics and themes very accessible, in the way that conversation tends to be more accessible than formal lecture. And as in a conversation, topics tend to emerge on their own and can be deeply engaging. Furthermore, the fact that these are the topics that emerged in conversations with some of the most important researchers in the field means that we will be exploring views that are close to the cutting edge of contemporary philosophy and science. So what we find expressed here are not so much the received and established views but a set of ongoing questions and discussions that define the field.

In other species, the SC plays a central role in voluntary as well as innate visual functions, including crucial contributions to selective attention and perceptual decision making. In the mouse, the possible role of the SC in voluntary visual choice behaviors has not been established. Here, we demonstrate that the mouse SC of both sexes plays a causal role in visual perceptual decision making by transiently inhibiting SC activity during an orientation change detection task. First, unilateral SC inhibition induced spatially specific deficits in detection. Hit rates were reduced, and reaction times increased for orientation changes in the contralateral but not ipsilateral visual field. Second, the deficits caused by SC inhibition were specific to a temporal epoch coincident with early visual burst responses in the SC. Inhibiting SC during this 100 ms period caused a contralateral detection deficit, whereas inhibition immediately before or after did not. Third, SC inhibition reduced visual detection sensitivity. Psychometric analysis revealed that inhibiting SC visual activity significantly increased detection thresholds for contralateral orientation changes. In addition, effects on detection thresholds and lapse rates caused by SC inhibition were larger in the presence of a competing visual stimulus, indicating a role for the mouse SC in visual target selection. Together, our results demonstrate that the mouse SC is necessary for the normal performance of voluntary visual choice behaviors. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The mouse superior colliculus (SC) has become a popular model for studying the circuit organization and development of the visual system. Although the SC is a fundamental component of the visual pathways in mice, its role in visual perceptual decision making is not clear. By investigating how temporally precise SC inhibition influenced behavioral performance during a visually guided orientation change detection task, we identified a 100 ms temporal epoch of SC visual activity that is crucial for the ability of mice to detect behaviorally relevant visual changes. In addition, we found that SC inhibition also caused deficits in visual target selection.

Evidence accumulation models (EAMs) commonly assume 2 broad variabilities in information processing: within trial variability, which is thought to reflect moment to moment fluctuations in perceptual processes, and between trial variability, which is thought to reflect variability in slower changing processes like attention, or systematic variability between the stimuli on different trials. Recently, Ratcliff, Voskuilen, and McKoon (2018) claimed to \"provide direct evidence that external noise is, in fact, required to explain the data from five simple two choice decision tasks\" (p. 33) suggesting that at least some portion of the between trial variability in information processing is due to \"noise.\" However, we argue that Ratcliff et al.

Furthermore, we contend that the concept of \"noise\" within cognitive models merely serves as a convenience parameter for sources of variability that we know exist but are unable to account for. Therefore, we question the usefulness of experiments aimed at testing the general existence of \"random\" variability and instead suggest that future research should attempt to replace the random variability terms within cognitive models with actual explanations of the process.

Existing approaches usually regard the pseudo label as the ground truth to fully exploit the unlabeled target domain data. Yet the pseudo labels of the target domain data are usually predicted by the model trained on the source domain. Thus, the generated labels inevitably contain the incorrect prediction due to the discrepancy between the training domain and the test domain, which could be transferred to the final adapted model and largely compromises the training process. To overcome the problem, this paper proposes to explicitly estimate the prediction uncertainty during training to rectify the pseudo label learning for unsupervised semantic segmentation adaptation. Given the input image, the model outputs the semantic segmentation prediction as well as the uncertainty of the prediction. Specifically, we model the uncertainty via the prediction variance and involve the uncertainty into the optimization objective.

However, only the direction and distance data of the object can be obtained, and point cloud data cannot be used to create a specific definition of the object. Therefore, only the movement of the point cloud data can be tracked using probability and classification algorithms based on image processing. To overcome this limitation, the study matches 3D LIDAR data with 2D image data through the fusion of hybrid level multi sensors. First, because 3D LIDAR data represents all objects in the sensor's detection range as dots, all unnecessary data, including ground data, is filtered out. The 3D Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm enables the extraction of ground data perpendicular to the reference estimation 3D plane and data at both ends through ground estimation. Classified environmental data facilitates the labeling of all objects within the viewing angle of 3D LIDAR based on the presence or absence of movement. The path of motion of the platform can be established by detecting whether objects within the region of interest are movable or static. Because LIDAR is based on 8 and 16 channel rotation mechanisms, real time data cannot be used to define objects. Instead, point clouds can be used to detect obstacles in the image through deep learning in the preliminary processing phase of the classification algorithm. By matching the labeling information of defined objects with the classified object cloud data obtained using 3D LIDAR, the exact dynamic trajectory and position of the defined objects can be calculated.

Subsequently COVID 19 spread rapidly around the world. To contain the ensuing pandemic, numerous countries have implemented control measures related to international travel, including border closures, partial travel restrictions, entry or exit screening, and quarantine of travellers. OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness of travel related control measures during the COVID 19 pandemic on infectious disease and screening related outcomes. SEARCH METHODS We searched MEDLINE, Embase and COVID 19 specific databases, including the WHO Global Database on COVID 19 Research, the Cochrane COVID 19 Study Register, and the CDC COVID 19 Research Database on 26 June 2020. We also conducted backward citation searches with existing reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA We considered experimental, quasi experimental, observational and modelling studies assessing the effects of travel related control measures affecting human travel across national borders during the COVID 19 pandemic. We also included studies concerned with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) as indirect evidence. Primary outcomes were cases avoided, cases detected and a shift in epidemic development due to the measures. Secondary outcomes were other infectious disease transmission outcomes, healthcare utilisation, resource requirements and adverse effects if identified in studies assessing at least one primary outcome. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS One review author screened titles and abstracts; all excluded abstracts were screened in duplicate. Two review authors independently screened full texts. One review author extracted data, assessed risk of bias and appraised study quality. At least one additional review author checked for correctness of all data reported in the 'Risk of bias' assessment, quality appraisal and data synthesis. For assessing the risk of bias and quality of included studies, we used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS 2) tool for observational studies concerned with screening, ROBINS I for observational ecological studies and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively. One review author assessed certainty of evidence with GRADE, and the review author team discussed ratings. MAIN RESULTS We included 40 records reporting on 36 unique studies. We found 17 modelling studies, 7 observational screening studies and one observational ecological study on COVID 19, four modelling and six observational studies on SARS, and one modelling study on SARS and MERS, covering a variety of settings and epidemic stages. Most studies compared travel related control measures against a counterfactual scenario in which the intervention measure was not implemented. However, some modelling studies described additional comparator scenarios, such as different levels of travel restrictions, or a combination of measures. There were concerns with the quality of many modelling studies and the risk of bias of observational studies. Many modelling studies used potentially inappropriate assumptions about the structure and input parameters of models, and failed to adequately assess uncertainty. Concerns with observational screening studies commonly related to the reference test and the flow of the screening process. Studies on COVID 19 Travel restrictions reducing cross border travel Eleven studies employed models to simulate a reduction in travel volume; one observational ecological study assessed travel restrictions in response to the COVID 19 pandemic. Very low certainty evidence from modelling studies suggests that when implemented at the beginning of the outbreak, cross border travel restrictions may lead to a reduction in the number of new cases of between 26% to 90% (4 studies) the number of deaths (1 study) the time to outbreak of between 2 and 26 days (2 studies) the risk of outbreak of between 1% to 37% (2 studies) and the effective reproduction number (1 modelling and 1 observational ecological study) Low certainty evidence from modelling studies suggests a reduction in the number of imported or exported cases of between 70% to 81% (5 studies) and in the growth acceleration of epidemic progression (1 study) Screening at borders with or without quarantine Evidence from three modelling studies of entry and exit symptom screening without quarantine suggests delays in the time to outbreak of between 1 to 183 days (very low certainty evidence) and a detection rate of infected travellers of between 10% to 53% (low certainty evidence) Six observational studies of entry and exit screening were conducted in specific settings such as evacuation flights and cruise ship outbreaks. Screening approaches varied but followed a similar structure, involving symptom screening of all individuals at departure or upon arrival, followed by quarantine, and different procedures for observation and PCR testing over a period of at least 14 days. The proportion of cases detected ranged from 0% to 91% (depending on the screening approach) and the positive predictive value ranged from 0% to 100% (very low certainty evidence) The outcomes, however, should be interpreted in relation to both the screening approach used and the prevalence of infection among the travellers screened; for example, symptom based screening alone generally performed worse than a combination of symptom based and PCR screening with subsequent observation during quarantine. Quarantine of travellers Evidence from one modelling study simulating a 14 day quarantine suggests a reduction in the number of cases seeded by imported cases; larger reductions were seen with increasing levels of quarantine compliance ranging from 277 to 19 cases with rates of compliance modelled between 70% to 100% (very low certainty evidence) AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS With much of the evidence deriving from modelling studies, notably for travel restrictions reducing cross border travel and quarantine of travellers, there is a lack of 'real life' evidence for many of these measures. The certainty of the evidence for most travel related control measures is very low and the true effects may be substantially different from those reported here. Nevertheless, some travel related control measures during the COVID 19 pandemic may have a positive impact on infectious disease outcomes. Broadly, travel restrictions may limit the spread of disease across national borders. Entry and exit symptom screening measures on their own are not likely to be effective in detecting a meaningful proportion of cases to prevent seeding new cases within the protected region; combined with subsequent quarantine, observation and PCR testing, the effectiveness is likely to improve. There was insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of travel related quarantine on its own. Some of the included studies suggest that effects are likely to depend on factors such as the stage of the epidemic, the interconnectedness of countries, local measures undertaken to contain community transmission, and the extent of implementation and adherence.", "venue": "The Cochrane database of systematic reviews", "year": 2020.0, "author_names": ["Jacob Burns", "Ani Movsisyan", "Jan M Stratil", "Michaela Coenen", "Karl M F Emmert-Fees", "Karin Geffert", "Sabine Hoffmann", "Olaf Horstick", "Michael Laxy", "Lisa Maria Pfadenhauer", "Peter von Philipsborn", "Kerstin Sell", "Stephan Voss", "Eva A Rehfuess"], "n_citations": 33, "n_key_citations": 0, "score": 0}, {"corpus_id": 219322508, "title": "The attitudes, perceptions and experiences of medical school applicants following the closure of schools and cancellation of public examinations in 2020 due to the COVID 19 pandemic", "abstract": "Objective To describe medical applicants' experiences of education and their views on changes to medical school admissions, including the awarding of calculated grades, following the 2020 closure of schools and universities, and the cancellation of public examinations in the United Kingdom due to the COVID 19/coronavirus pandemic.

Design Cross sectional questionnaire study forming part of the longitudinal United Kingdom Medical Applicant Cohort Study (UKMACS) Setting United Kingdom medical school admissions. Participants 2887 participants (68% female; 64% with at least one degree educated parent; 63% with at least one parent in the highest socioeconomic group) completed an online questionnaire between 8th and 22nd April 2020. To be invited to complete the questionnaire, participants had to have registered to take the University Clinical Admissions Test (UCAT) in 2019 and to have agreed to be invited to take part in the study, or they needed to have completed one or more previous UKMACS questionnaires.

Main outcome measures Views on calculated grades, views on potential changes to medical school admissions and teaching in 2020 and 2021, reported experiences of education following the closure of educational institutions in March 2020. Results Respondents had concerns about the calculated grades that will replace A level examinations, especially female applicants and applicants from Black Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds who felt teachers would find it difficult to grade and rank students accurately, as well as those from non selective state schools and those living in deprived areas who had some concerns about the grade standardisation process. Calculated grades were not considered fair enough by a majority to use in the acceptance or rejection of medical offer holders, but several measures including interview and aptitude test scores were considered fair enough to use in combination. Respondents from non selective state (public) schools reported less use of and less access to educational resources compared to their counterparts at private/selective schools.

So far, human RBCs have been produced in vitro using diverse sources: hematopoietic stem cells (SCs) embryonic SCs and induced pluripotent SCs. The existing, even safest core of conventional cellular bioproducts destined for transfusion have some shortcoming in respects to: donor dependency variability in terms of hematological /immunological and process/ storage period issues. SCs derived transfusable RBC bioproducts, as one blood group type for all, were highly complex to work out. Moreover, the strategies for their successful production are often dependent upon the right selection of starting source materials and the composition and the stability of the right expansion media and the strict compliance to GMP regulatory processes. In this mini review we highlight some model studies, which showed that the efficiency and the functionality of RBCs that could be produced by the various types of SCs, in relation to the in vitro culture procedures are such that they may, potentially, be used at an industrial level. However, all cultured products do not have an unlimited life due to the critical metabolic pathways or the metabolites produced.

Pandemic related clerkship disruptions mean medical students face new challenges in navigating the residency selection process. In this article, we describe barriers and opportunities created by the COVID 19 pandemic for applicants in ranking potential Canadian neurology residency programs.

This broadly includes but is not limited to the availability of subspecialty and generalist expertise, population catchment area, physical location, and facultyto trainee ratio. In our experience, the breadth of neurological clinical experiences is enhanced by diverse subspecialty representation among faculty balanced with a generalist approach to the most common neurologic presentations, high patient volumes, and low faculty trainee ratios. Yet, a good neurology training program need not feature all these characteristics. A broad training experience in clinical neurology still remains fundamental to acquiring the knowledge and clinical skills necessary for independent practice as a neurologist.

The hemagglutinin (HA) gene of 2009 H1N1 is derived from \"classical swine H1N1\" virus, which likely shares a common ancestor with the human H1N1 virus that caused the pandemic in 1918, whose descendant viruses are still circulating in the human population with highly altered antigenicity of HA. However, information on the structural basis to compare the HA antigenicity among 2009 H1N1, the 1918 pandemic, and seasonal human H1N1 viruses has been lacking. By homology modeling of the HA structure, here we show that HAs of 2009 H1N1 and the 1918 pandemic virus share a significant number of amino acid residues in known antigenic sites, suggesting the existence of common epitopes for neutralizing antibodies cross reactive to both HAs. It was noted that the early human H1N1 viruses isolated in the 1930s 1940s still harbored some of the original epitopes that are also found in 2009 H1N1. Interestingly, while 2009 H1N1 HA lacks the multiple N glycosylations that have been found to be associated with an antigenic change of the human H1N1 virus during the early epidemic of this virus, 2009 H1N1 HA still retains unique three codon motifs, some of which became N glycosylation sites via a single nucleotide mutation in the human H1N1 virus. We thus hypothesize that the 2009 H1N1 HA antigenic sites involving the conserved amino acids will soon be targeted by antibody mediated selection pressure in humans. Indeed, amino acid substitutions predicted here are occurring in the recent 2009 H1N1 variants. The present study suggests that antibodies elicited by natural infection with the 1918 pandemic or its early descendant viruses play a role in specific immunity against 2009 H1N1, and provides an insight into future likely antigenic changes in the evolutionary process of 2009 H1N1 in the human population.", "venue": "PloS one", "year": 2010.0, "author_names": ["Manabu Igarashi", "Kimihito Ito", "Reiko Yoshida", "Daisuke Tomabechi", "Hiroshi Kida", "Ayato Takada"], "n_citations": 157, "n_key_citations": 16, "score": 0}, {"corpus_id": 221788870, "title": "Triaging Interventional Pain Procedures During COVID 19 or Related Elective Surgery Restrictions: Evidence Informed Guidance from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP)", "abstract": "BACKGROUND The COVID 19 pandemic has worsened the pain and suffering of chronic pain patients due to stoppage of \"elective\" interventional pain management and office visits across the United States. The reopening of America and restarting of interventional techniques and elective surgical procedures has started. Unfortunately, with resurgence in some states, restrictions are once again being imposed. In addition, even during the Phase II and III of reopening, chronic pain patients and interventional pain physicians have faced difficulties because of the priority selection of elective surgical procedures.Chronic pain patients require high intensity care, specifically during a pandemic such as COVID 19. Consequently, it has become necessary to provide guidance for triaging interventional pain procedures, or related elective surgery restrictions during a pandemic. OBJECTIVES The aim of these guidelines is to provide education and guidance for physicians, healthcare administrators, the public and patients during the COVID 19 pandemic. Our goal is to restore the opportunity to receive appropriate care for our patients who may benefit from interventional techniques. METHODS The American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) has created the COVID 19 Task Force in order to provide guidance for triaging interventional pain procedures or related elective surgery restrictions to provide appropriate access to interventional pain management (IPM) procedures in par with other elective surgical procedures. In developing the guidance, trustworthy standards and appropriate disclosures of conflicts of interest were applied with a section of a panel of experts from various regions, specialties, types of practices (private practice, community hospital and academic institutes) and groups. The literature pertaining to all aspects of COVID 19, specifically related to epidemiology, risk factors, complications, morbidity and mortality, and literature related to risk mitigation and stratification was reviewed. The evidence informed with the incorporation of the best available research and practice knowledge was utilized, instead of a simplified evidence based approach. Consequently, these guidelines are considered evidence informed with the incorporation of the best available research and practice knowledge. RESULTS The Task Force defined the medical urgency of a case and developed an IPM acuity scale for elective IPM procedures with 3 tiers. These included emergent, urgent, and elective procedures. Examples of emergent and urgent procedures included new onset or exacerbation of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) acute trauma or acute exacerbation of degenerative or neurological disease resulting in impaired mobility and inability to perform activities of daily living. Examples include painful rib fractures affecting oxygenation and post dural puncture headaches limiting the ability to sit upright, stand and walk. In addition, urgent procedures include procedures to treat any severe or debilitating disease that prevents the patient from carrying out activities of daily living. Elective procedures were considered as any condition that is stable and can be safely managed with alternatives. LIMITATIONS COVID 19 continues to be an ongoing pandemic. When these recommendations were developed, different stages of reopening based on geographical regulations were in process. The pandemic continues to be dynamic creating every changing evidence based guidance. Consequently, we provided evidence informed guidance. CONCLUSION The COVID 19 pandemic has created unprecedented challenges in IPM creating needless suffering for pain patients. Many IPM procedures cannot be indefinitely postponed without adverse consequences. Chronic pain exacerbations are associated with marked functional declines and risks with alternative treatment modalities. They must be treated with the concern that they deserve. Clinicians must assess patients, local healthcare resources, and weigh the risks and benefits of a procedure against the risks of suffering from disabling pain and exposure to the COVID 19 virus.", "venue": "Pain physician", "year": 2020.0, "author_names": ["Christopher G Gharibo", "Amit Sharma", "Amol Soin", "Shalini Shah", "Sudhir Diwan", "Ricardo M Buenaventura", "Devi E Nampiaparampil", "Steve M Aydin", "Sanjay Bakshi", "Salahadin Abdi", "Sachin Sunny Jha", "Harold J Cordner", "Alan David Kaye", "Alaa Abd-Elsayed", "Kenneth D Candido", "Nebojsa Nick Knezevic", "Sairam L Atluri", "Bradley W Wargo", "Mahendra R Sanapati", "Sukdeb Datta", "Joshua A Hirsch", "Laxmaiah Manchikanti", "Kartic Rajput"], "n_citations": 9, "n_key_citations": 0, "score": 0}, {"corpus_id": 222177711, "title": "Beef and Pork Marketing Margins and Price Spreads during COVID 19", "abstract": "Abstract COVID 19 related disruptions led to a historic rise in the spread between livestock and wholesale meat prices.

Pharmaceutical formulators will enjoy the availability of the harmonized and fingerprinted (in terms of functionality testing) excipients, and formulations will be developed using databases (preformulation and compaction data banks, etc. (2) The awareness of and the use of artificial intelligence based expert systems (rule based systems, fuzzy logic, genetic algorithm, artificial neural networks [ANNs] simulations, etc. in the areas of preformulation, formulation and process development, regulatory affairs, new drug delivery system development, project management, and all other areas of pharmaceutical science will increase dramatically.

INTRODUCTION Risk management in the financial sector is very important since the ultimate goal of the institution is to maximize revenues and shareholders value. Moreover, the recent financial crisis was marked by market volatility, lack of liquidity in many financial markets and increased systemic risk (Delloitte, 2011) This crisis has forced banks to take a critical look at how they manage risk and has exhibited some significant weaknesses in risk management in financial industry (KPMG, 2009) This difficulty has highlighted the importance of risk management; as a result many institutions have reviewed their risk management models. An active role was undertaken in re examining their approaches of risk management, the establishment of risk management policy and approval of risk appetite. Solid practices risk management in the banking sector is important for financial stability and economic development. A robust framework of risk management can help banks to reduce their exposure to risks, and enhancing their ability to compete in the market (Mirakhor and Iqbal, 2007) Reducing the exposure will reduce systemic risk. Thus, it is necessary for banks to put in place a comprehensive risk management to identify, measure, monitor, manage, and report the various categories of risk. Risk management is a key element of the strategic management of the organization. This is the process whereby organizations methodically address the risks their activities with the goal of achieving sustained benefit. In this regard, CBSB (2011) forces authorities to ensure that banks have in place a comprehensive risk management. The process of risk management is a structured and consistent approach to identify and understand the potential risk factors and evaluation of consequences and uncertainties associated with these risk factors identified. Based on this information, the best plan of action is evaluated and selected to address identified risks and achieve the desired objectives. This study extends the work of Tafri et al. (2011) but differ in some aspects. Firstly, the questionnaire is similar but not identical; in fact it investigates the liquidity risk, which has not been examined by Tafri et al. (2011) Secondly, this study explores the risk management tools practiced in Islamic and conventional banks in a different environment (MENA Middle Eastern and North Africa region) The main purpose is to examine the current practices in risk management methodologies of Islamic and conventional banks in the MENA region. It discusses and analyses the tools and methods used in managing credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and operational risk among Islamic and conventional banks in the aim to identify the convergence in the practices of risk management and risk mitigation between Islamic and conventional banks.

All data point out that the use of a reductant is needed to fully solubilize Mn from spent batteries during the leaching process.

In recent years, phase change material (PCM) is widely used as the working medium of battery thermal management system, which is an effective method to control the working temperature of batteries.

These thermophysical models can accurately predict the distribution of heating area and the rising trend of temperature, which can provide thought support for the development and construction of thermal management system or model, as well as provide theoretical basis for the established thermal management system.

Final analysis was performed on 9,353 participants (4,098 men, mean age 50.3 years; 5,255 women, mean age 50.8) using a Cox proportional hazards model. Death probabilities over a 10 year period from CHD, stroke, and all CVD were calculated and displayed as color coding on each chart by combining 10 year age, systolic blood pressure, smoking, and serum total cholesterol and glucose levels. Six different colors corresponding to probabilities of death were displayed on each chart.

There is no doubt that it is an innovative tool, corresponding to the Framingham Score,2 that can be applied to Japanese people. However, we occasionally face some problems when we apply it in the clinical setting. The risk assessment chart is a model that assesses risk by estimating the probability of death from cardiovascular disease based on various risk factors. The chart does not involve complex calculations and includes 6 color coded ranks, thus providing a quick reference in the clinical setting. The range in which values can be extrapolated is indicated, thereby obviating the risk of extrapolating extreme values that is associated with formulas. At this point this chart can be an innovative tool. However, in clinical studies, model formulas are more useful than charts in some cases. For example, the various probabilities of death are conventionally calculated as continuous values, which in a 6 rank system would be converted to discrete classes and become less precise. When calculating the number needed to treat from the absolute mortality rate, the certainty of values would be reduced by the width of the ranks. In addition, in today's highly computerized environment, formulas may be easier to use than charts when analyzing many patients at once. Because the study did not specify the b value for each risk factor or the total mortality rate in each population based on the Cox proportional hazards model, the reader is unable to calculate and reproduce the probability of death in each population. If these values were shown, the degree of the effect of each risk factor could be assessed. Moreover, as the goodness of fit of this model was not described, its level of explanation can not be inferred. Based on this, we believe it would be useful to release more fundamental and practical indices about this chart, as with the Framingham Score.2", "venue": "Circulation journal official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society", "year": 2011.0, "author_names": ["Yuichiro Yamada", "Shoji Haruta"], "n_citations": 0, "n_key_citations": 0, "score": 0}, {"corpus_id": 25176449, "title": "[Drug use evaluation of antidyslipidemic agents at a community hospital in Japan]", "abstract": "OBJECTIVES In recent years, the therapeutic implications of dyslipidemias have been clarified in large scale epidemiologic surveys, and the validity of pharmacotherapy has been established. We investigated the practical realities of pharmacotherapy for dyslipidemias at a community hospital in Japan. METHODS Medical chart surveys were performed retrospectively on 451 dyslipidemic outpatients who visited a community hospital in Japan in July 1997. We collected clinical data from medical charts regarding selected drugs for dyslipidemias, serum lipid levels before drug treatment and after one year of treatment, and risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) RESULTS Regardless of dyslipidemia phenotype, approximately 80% of patients were administered statins. The possibility was raised that physicians recorded risk factors in medical charts incompletely, particularly with regard to family CHD history, smoking, and obesity. Based on Japanese and us guidelines for dyslipidemias, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels fully satisfied the requirements for initiating pharmacotherapy in the present study. However, the higher the risk of CHD, the lower the percentage of subjects who met the treatment goals defined by both guidelines. Only 23% of patients at high risk for CHD controlled LDL cholesterol sufficiently based on Japanese guidelines.

The main component of the red color is carminic acid (CA) Carmine is an aluminum or calcium chelated product of CA. CA and carmine usually contain contaminating proteins, including a 38 kDa protein thought to be the primary allergen. Severe allergic reactions manifest as anaphylaxis. The aim of this study was to review all Japanese reported cases and propose useful diagnostic chart. METHODS All reported Japanese cases of cochineal dye induced immediate allergy were reviewed, and newly registered cases were examined by skin prick test (SPT) with cochineal extract (CE) and measurement of CE and carmine specific serum IgE test. Two dimensional (2D) western blotting using patient serum was conducted to identify the antigen. RESULTS Twenty two Japanese cases have been reported. SPT and the level of specific IgE test indicated that six cases should be newly registered as cochineal dye allergy. All cases were adult females, and all cases except three involved anaphylaxis; 13 cases involved past history of local symptoms associated with cosmetics use. Japanese strawberry juice and fish meat sausage, and European processed foods (especially macarons made in France) and drinks were recent major sources of allergen. 2D western blotting showed that patient IgE reacted to the 38 kDa protein and other proteins.

Numerous methods have been proposed to achieve better saliency results. However, we find that previous visual saliency methods are not reliable enough to provide meaningful interpretation through a simple sanity check: saliency methods are required to explain the output of non maximum prediction classes, which are usually not ground truth classes. For example, let the methods interpret an image of \"dog\" given a wrong class label \"fish\" as the query. This procedure can test whether these methods reliably interpret model's predictions based on existing features that appear in the data. Our experiments show that previous methods failed to pass the test by generating similar saliency maps or scattered patterns. This false saliency response can be dangerous in certain scenarios, such as medical diagnosis. We find that these failure cases are mainly due to the attribution vanishing and adversarial noise within these methods. In order to learn reliable visual saliency, we propose a simple method that requires the output of the model to be close to the original output while learning an explanatory saliency mask. To enhance the smoothness of the optimized saliency masks, we then propose a simple Hierarchical Attribution Fusion (HAF) technique. In order to fully evaluate the reliability of visual saliency methods, we propose a new task Disturbed Weakly Supervised Object Localization (D WSOL) to measure whether these methods can correctly attribute the model's output to existing features.

A bioinformatic network analysis of all genes reported to be differentially expressed in human VS revealed a pro inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF kB) as a central molecule in VS pathobiology.

The hallmark of NF2 is vestibular schwannomas (VSs) also known as acoustic neuromas, which occur on the vestibular nerves that connect the inner ear with the brain. Initially, VSs cause hearing loss. However, as they grow, they can compress the brainstem and cause death. Current treatment options are limited to surgical removal and radiation therapy, both of which carry substantial risks, including deafness and facial paralysis. Although drug therapies against NF2 are gaining momentum, more effective and better tolerated drugs are sorely needed. Because NF2 tumors are typically slowly growing and non malignant, even therapies that simply reduce tumor volume and retard growth can be lifesaving. The most successful drug used today to treat NF2, bevacizumab, works in only about 50% of patients in halting tumor growth or causing tumor shrinkage. Bevacizumab is known to inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) but its precise mechanism of action in VSs is unknown. Our overriding objective it to develop new and better drug therapies to help people with NF2. Using an unbiased bioinformatic approach that synthesizes published knowledge on the genes that are known to be aberrantly expressed in NF2, we have identified a key role for nuclear factor kappa B (NF Kappa B We hypothesize that increased NF B signaling in VS contributes to abnormal growth, and that inhibition of the NF Kappa B pathway can prevent growth and promote death of VSs.

In this study, an interval multistage joint probabilistic left hand side chance constrained programming (IMJLCP) model is developed for crop area planning in response to these issues. This method is derived from incorporating the techniques of multistage stochastic programming and joint probabilistic left hand side chance constrained programming within a general interval optimization framework. It can address uncertainties presented as both discrete intervals and probability distributions, and also reflect dynamic characteristics of the system conditions. Moreover, it can reflect randomness in the left hand side of the constraints and examine the reliability level of satisfying constraints at both joint and individual probabilities. The developed method is applied to a case study of dynamic agricultural water management and irrigated crop area planning in different growth stages in the middle reaches of Heihe River Basin, taking groundwater and surface water use into account. Six scenarios with different joint (i.e. p 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1) and individual probabilities (i.e. same and increasing) of the irrigation quota are examined, and a multilayered scenario tree will be provided for a dynamic analysis in a planning horizon. The results indicate that different levels of constraints violation reflect the attitudes of managers to economic benefit and risk. Furthermore, it can help managers to identify desired decision alternatives in intra and inter seasonal water allocation among different crops in different subareas. This application makes it highly feasible to enhance the efficiency of irrigation water and ensure sustainable use of water resources, especially for the arid regions dominated by agriculture.", "venue": "", "year": 2017.0, "author_names": ["Chenglong Zhang", "Mo Li", "Ping Guo"], "n_citations": 28, "n_key_citations": 0, "score": 0}]}

The kinetics of crystallization under both static and cyclic deformation is also discussed, as well as the influence of different factors, depending either on material composition (crosslink density, carbon black fillers) or on external parameters (temperature, strain rate.", "venue": "", "year": 2011.0, "author_names": ["Bertrand Huneau"], "n_citations": 149, "n_key_citations": 4, "score": 0}, {"corpus_id": 139657514, "title": "X Ray Diffraction under Extreme Conditions at the Advanced Light Source", "abstract": "The more than a century old technique of X ray diffraction in either angle or energy dispersive mode has been used to probe materials' microstructure in a number of ways, including phase identification, stress measurements, structure solutions, and the determination of physical properties such as compressibility and phase transition boundaries.

Secondary objectives were to evaluate benefits and harms of lifelong ultrasound (US) surveillance and treatment outcomes for any large aneurysms that develop in the screened population. Methods: We searched multiple databases (eg, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase Classic and Embase, and the Cochrane Library) on February 16, 2016. Using a liberal accelerated method, two reviewers screened titles and abstracts for relevance and subsequently screened full text studies. General study characteristics (eg, country, study design, number of participants) and data (eg, number of men with subaneurysmal aortas, quality of life [QoL] mortality) were extracted. One reviewer performed data extraction and risk of bias assessments, and a second reviewer verified 100% of studies. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus. Results: The search identified 37 relevant studies ranging in size from 3 to 52,690 participants. Prevalence of subaneurysmal aortas ranged from 1.14% to 8.53% and 55% to 88% of these men progressed to a 3.0 cm aneurysm by 5 years of follow up. Risk factors for growth included the infrarenal aortic diameter at age 65 years, having a subaneurysmal aorta at age 65 years, and current smoking. The 36 Item Short Form Health Survey was the most commonly used tool to measure QoL, and QoL was typically lower in people with abdominal aortic aneurysm. Anxiety and depression levels did not differ significantly between comparison groups in any studies. Four studies reported on the number of men whose aorta was subaneurysmal on initial US who went on to surgery. Overall, 10% (57/547) of men initially measuring in the subaneurysmal range progressed to abdominal aortic aneurysm >5.4 cm and received elective surgery; 1% (6/547) received emergency surgery because of a ruptured aorta.

We aimed to assess the effect omission of whole breast radiotherapy would have on local control in older women at low risk of local recurrence at 5 years. METHODS Between April 16, 2003, and Dec 22, 2009, 1326 women aged 65 years or older with early breast cancer judged low risk (ie, hormone receptor positive, axillary node negative, T1 T2 up to 3 cm at the longest dimension, and clear margins; grade 3 tumour histology or lymphovascular invasion, but not both, were permitted) who had had breast conserving surgery and were receiving adjuvant endocrine treatment, were recruited into a phase 3 randomised controlled trial at 76 centres in four countries. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to either whole breast radiotherapy (40 50 Gy in 15 25 fractions) or no radiotherapy by computer generated permuted block randomisation, stratified by centre, with a block size of four. The primary endpoint was ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence. Follow up continues and will end at the 10 year anniversary of the last randomised patient. Analyses were done by intention to treat. The trial is registered on ISRCTN.com, number ISRCTN95889329. FINDINGS 658 women who had undergone breast conserving surgery and who were receiving adjuvant endocrine treatment were randomly assigned to receive whole breast irradiation and 668 were allocated to no further treatment. After median follow up of 5 years (IQR 3*84 6*05) ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence was 1*3% (95% CI 0*2 2*3; n=5) in women assigned to whole breast radiotherapy and 4*1% (2*4 5*7; n=26) in those assigned no radiotherapy (p=0*0002) Compared with women allocated to whole breast radiotherapy, the univariate hazard ratio for ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence in women assigned to no radiotherapy was 5*19 (95% CI 1*99 13*52; p=0*0007) No differences in regional recurrence, distant metastases, contralateral breast cancers, or new breast cancers were noted between groups. 5 year overall survival was 93*9% (95% CI 91*8 96*0) in both groups (p=0*34) 89 women died; eight of 49 patients allocated to no radiotherapy and four of 40 assigned to radiotherapy died from breast cancer. INTERPRETATION Postoperative whole breast radiotherapy after breast conserving surgery and adjuvant endocrine treatment resulted in a significant but modest reduction in local recurrence for women aged 65 years or older with early breast cancer 5 years after randomisation. However, the 5 year rate of ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence is probably low enough for omission of radiotherapy to be considered for some patients.

The results are analyzed. METHODS Cases of CM treated using atlantoaxial fixation during the period from January 2010 to November 2013 were reviewed and analyzed. Surgery was aimed at segmental arthrodesis. RESULTS The author treated 65 patients with CM in the defined study period. Fifty five patients had associated syringomyelia. Forty six patients had associated basilar invagination. Thirty seven patients had both basilar invagination and syringomyelia. Three patients had been treated earlier using foramen magnum decompression and duraplasty. According to the extent of their functional capabilities, patients were divided into 5 clinical grades. On the basis of the type of facetal alignment and atlantoaxial instability, the patients were divided into 3 groups. Type I dislocation (17 patients) was anterior atlantoaxial instability wherein the facet of the atlas was dislocated anterior to the facet of the axis. Type II dislocation (31 patients) was posterior atlantoaxial instability wherein the facet of the atlas was dislocated posterior to the facet of the axis. Type III dislocation (17 patients) was the absence of demonstrable facetal malalignment and was labeled as \"central\" atlantoaxial dislocation. In 18 patients, dynamic images showed vertical, mobile and at least partially reducible atlantoaxial dislocation. All patients were treated with atlantoaxial plate and screw fixation using techniques described in 1994 and 2004. Foramen magnum decompression or syrinx manipulation was not performed in any patient. Occipital bone and subaxial spinal elements were not included in the fixation construct. One patient died, and death occurred in the immediate postoperative phase and was related to a vertebral artery injury incurred during the operation. One patient had persistent symptoms. In the rest of the patients there was gratifying clinical improvement. More remarkably, in 7 patients, the symptoms of lower cranial nerve paresis improved. No patient worsened in their neurological function after surgery. Reductions in the size of the syrinx and regression of the CM were observed in 6 of 11 cases in which postoperative MRI was possible. During the follow up period, there was no delayed worsening of neurological function or symptoms in any patient. Sixty three patients improved after surgery, and the improvement was sustained during the average follow up period of 18 months. CONCLUSIONS On the basis of outcomes in this study, it appears that the pathogenesis of CM with or without associated basilar invagination and/or syringomyelia is primarily related to atlantoaxial instability. The data suggest that the surgical treatment in these cases should be directed toward atlantoaxial stabilization and segmental arthrodesis. Except in cases in which there is assimilation of the atlas, inclusion of the occipital bone is neither indicated nor provides optimum stability.

Over the past few decades, replication has always been a reliable way to make sure data is constantly available, even though it has been proven to induce higher costs due to the additional required storage. Since the early 2000s, erasure codes have been developed as a means to drastically reduce the overhead, while enormously increasing efficiency and providing significant error correcting capabilities. One of the most well known erasure coding policies is Reed Solomon (RS) a highly consistent, reliable, and efficient technique to store and recover data, currently used at Facebook's data centers. Other frequently mentioned policies are Pyramid codes, a variant of Locally Repairable Codes (LRCs) that make use of a pyramid based scheme to generate additional parity groups for each level, and has been used at Microsoft's Windows Live servers. Apache Hadoop is an open source distributed framework used for scalable processing that has recently introduced erasure coding policies to their storage capabilities. NorNet Core (or NorNet Core Testbed1) a distributed academic network, will be used as the main scenario to measure, compare, and analyze these different erasure coding policies and their efficiency. Based on simulations of physically distributed storage, this thesis will show how minimal alterations in commonly known codes (such as RS codes) can converge in a Pyramid based code that could severely enhance fault tolerance and performance.

There were correlations between changes in depression score and inspection of updates AOI, with reduced depression scores associated with increased inspection of updates. Finally, self reported duration of participants' typical Facebook sessions did not correlate with eye tracking measures but were associated with increased Facebook addiction scores and greater increases in depression scores.

K. (1995) Crisis renewal: Meeting the challenge of organizational change. From The Management of Innovation and Change Series, Michael L Tushman and Andrew H. Van de Ven, Series Editors. Boston MA: Harvard Business School Press. By Virgil Smith Biola University This book will prove useful to the practitioner who believes his or her organization is growing stagnant. Hurst uses ideas from Population Ecology Theory and Chaos Theory, augmented by case histories of firms that have faced dramatic change, to explain why organizations cease to innovate, and what the owner/manager can do about it. He begins by using an analogy of an organizational system the Bushmen culture in the Kalahari Desert. This hunter gatherer culture, overtime, was transformed into a herder society the point is that organizations follow the same patterns. Hurst's argument is that many of the features that managers seek in the modern organization were present in hunter bands. Each person within the band was multi skilled, there was little hierarchy, and there was a high level of open communication, trust, and empowerment. These hunter bands were traditionally self organizing entities which appeared chaotic from the outside, but made perfect sense to the band itself. More recently the lure of material wealth has caused the Bushmen hunter gatherer culture to be transformed into a herder culture. With the advent of the possible ownership of material property the hunter bands suddenly needed a hierarchy to resolve disputes over ownership of the property, and the hierarchy diminished the power of the individuals at lower levels of the hierarchy. Also, band members tended to specialize for material productivity, becoming single skilled. Since members were afraid that someone might be trying to get what they had, communication became less open, and trust diminished. Once the transformation had occurred from a hunter way of life to a herder society the Bushmen culture looked very much like a traditional organization. While the hunter culture was self organizing and looked chaotic, the herder culture was structured from the top down and looked much more orderly. Hurst uses the analogy of the hunters and the herders throughout the book. The hunter culture with its open communication, trust, and empowerment allows for the learning necessary for quick, creative responses and adaptation to opportunities. This, in turn, allows the clan to deal with an environment that is treacherous and constantly changing. Indeed, when the Bushmen were hunters, they were constantly on the move, seeking sustenance where they could get it. On the other hand, the herder culture with its hierarchy and specialization allows the band to be maximally productive in a much more stable \"herding\" environment, where they stay in one place and gather possessions. Using the previous analogy, Hurst says that most entrepreneurial firms start out as hunters but, over time and with success, they are transformed into herders. However, they still need the innovative skills of the hunters. He says, \"[Y]oung businesses begin their lives as informal, learning organizations, but if successful, they become formal, performance organizations. It is thus helpful to think of learning and performing as two ends of a continuum with the young organizations starting off on the left hand side and moving toward the right as they age\" (Page 33, italics in original) According to Hurst, the current adoption of organizational methods such as interdisciplinary teams and networks is an attempt on the part of managers to go back to being hunters. Small, new organizations are held together through the self selection of members into the organization, and an overriding agreement with the organizational mission everything else is worked out as needed. Strategy in new organizations tends to be emergent, while it is top down in more established companies.", "venue": "", "year": 1999.0, "author_names": ["Virgil O Smith"], "n_citations": 36, "n_key_citations": 3, "score": 0}, {"corpus_id": 84277323, "title": "Governance of innovation in animal production: new roles for science, business and the public sector", "abstract": "Abstract To discuss the governance of innovation in animal production three innovation models are placed in the context of the phases of development of agriculture (according to Hurst, 1997, Crisis and renewal meeting the challenge of organizational change. Scriptum, Schiedam) The phases distinguished are spontaneous action (breakthrough of a new paradigm, rational action (heyday) and action under restrictions (new choices for science, business and public) The associated innovation models are the Participatory Technology Development (PTD) model, the linear model and the chain link model. It is argued that the linear model has been the predominant one in the past half century where food security was the prime drive for action. In the last decade this drive clearly fades away and new goals of animal production emerge, requiring another innovation model. Using the examples of two firms it is illustrated that the chain link model, along with the linear model seems an efficient way to deal with changing circumstances. To show the dynamics of the system, the model is extended into one in which the three models of innovation do not follow after each other (with the chain model as the end model) but where both PTD as the chain link model are starting points in situations of change to take aspects of the linear model on board when heyday emerges. It is argued that in the more dynamic context where heyday clearly is not predominant another role of researchers is required. Where during heyday, participation in the process of optimisation and finetuning of production systems is a successful approach, during the other two phases a problem observation role is required, where the researcher takes part in the public debate on direction and usefulness of solutions.", "venue": "", "year": 2001.0, "author_names": ["Gert Van Dijk", "P van Boekel"], "n_citations": 16, "n_key_citations": 0, "score": 0}, {"corpus_id": 225002473, "title": "Leadership that Generates Resilience: An Introduction to Second Resilience Forum", "abstract": "In challenging and strenuous times such as during the current pandemic, public and private leadership is faced with extraordinary pressures on their leadership. On what basis should urgent yet critical decisions be made? And practically, how to legitimately lock down a society, closing down businesses and educational institutions, or decide to leave them open when such decisions carry heavy costs to people and organizations? In the context of resilient leadership, Hamel and Valikangas (2003) proposed the concept of 'Zero Trauma Transformation' as foundational to the quest for resilience. The notion was premised on being able to meet major changes before they turn into crises, including conquering denial of the need for change, valuing variety in strategic options and liberating resources to their most innovative uses, and embracing both efficiency and renewal. These four leadership challenges were identified as cognitive, strategic, political, and ideological, and meeting such challenges was suggested necessary for continuous strategic renewal. In a societal crisis situation such as the current COVID 19 epidemic that has profound implications for people's livelihoods, well being, and even political stability, there may be a further challenge worthy of contemplation. Namely, on what moral grounds may leadership be built? Even further: how might those decisions, and the accompanying leadership, be generative of resilience strengthening the society rather than diminishing future capability for coping? Such societal, and economic, resilience is about to be tested should the second, or third wave, of the COVID 19 virus spread. We conclude leadership is to become a moral endeavor should leaders wish to generate resilience in a major crisis. The exercise of leadership under such conditions can be informed by moral philosophy.

This familyowned business transformed a natural disaster into organizational renewal. Teaming provided the engine for organizational alignment and employee empowerment, and changed the culture of the organization, facilitating the sharing of essential knowledge. We describe methods used to create the changes, and the internal resistance and external pressures that threatened crossfunctional teams. Finally, strategies for creating and sustaining resilient leadership teams near and at the top of the organization are discussed. Introduction This presentation considers strategies for developing and sustaining resilient crossfunctional teams in a crucible of recurring turbulence and threat. The original threat to the organization's continued existence the fire was external, and understandable to all. As the organization rebuilt its facilities physically, it became increasingly clear that great agility would be required to manage the market consequences of the fire, and crossfunctional teams were created to sustain the momentum of the reconstruction. More subtle and pernicious threats arose in the form of internal resistance to transformation, despite strong evidence supporting the need for change. The story begins, however, with Malden Mills facing a natural disaster. Celebrating his 70th birthday at Boston's Cafe Budapest with a small circle of friends and family, the CEO of Maiden Mills Industries received word from frantic managers that the Mill was in flames. Aaron and Louise Feuerstein quickly drove to nearby Lawrence, and joined thousands of anguished people who watched the six alarm fire rage out of control. \"It looked like Rome burning,\" said Louise, \"with 45 mile an hour winds whipping flames from one factory to a second factory to the five story main building:\" All that remained standing by morning was a lone brick tower. The livelihoods of 3,100 people appeared to be in ruins, like the ash and twisted rubble that remained. On the following morning, 1000 workers came to hear the CEO speak about the future. The CEO had options. He could manufacture off shore, like many others in the US textile business. He could accept the insurance payment and close the Mill. \"When all the textile mills in Lawrence ran out to get cheaper labor in the South, we stuck,\" Feuerstein said. We are going to stay and rebuild.\" Remember, everyone,\" Feuerstein added, \"we're playing to a higher judge. Don't tell me the job can't be done:\" The next day, stunned workers received their pay in full, including a $275 Christmas bonus, with a note from the CEO. \"Do not despair,\" he wrote, \"God bless each of you.\" How did the fire help pave the way to a team based approach? Several months before the fire, GLS Consulting, Inc. and Malden Mills managers piloted the team concept in the division that later burned to the ground. We conducted an organizational audit and provided feedback in the September, organized a joint unionmanagement Steering Committee, created a customized curriculum, and started team training in the beginning of November just six weeks before the fire. GLS principals were at the plant a day after the fire, pitching in wherever we could be useful. We were certain the team project would be sacrificed, given the crisis of rebuilding the Mill. For six months we offered pro bono services, and kept in close touch with the CEO and key managers. Most key executives perceived the team project as \"icing on the cake\" last in the long line of priorities for rebuilding. Despite opposition from some senior managers, the CEO strengthened his resolve to change the culture of the organization from a traditional manufacturing system to a more participative, cooperative, team based system. For the CEO, the fire created a window of opportunity for change. He strongly believed in the importance of attending to the \"human equation\" in management. He believed that Maiden Mills' employees made the company great, and that they deserved the best wages and benefits in the industry. A team based organization would take his ideas about the \"human equation\" beyond traditional HR policies, creating an infrastructure that would help Maiden Mills emerge from the ashes an even stronger organization. Manufacturing resumed on a small scale in undamaged facilities soon after the fire. Most customers remained loyal. A year after the fire, and despite a variety of setbacks and financial difficulties, a new state of the art manufacturing plant geared up to fill customer orders, and a team based strategy for renewal was well underway. It began in the smaller, upholstery fabrics division of the company, and was eventually extended to include the larger apparel fabrics division. What was the pre fire system like? Systemic problems revealed in our initial diagnostic audit of the smaller division were confirmed by a supplemental audit of the larger manufacturing division. Both studies pointed to the need for a structural approach that was very different from traditional \"who reports to whom\" reorganizations. The following are some of the undesirable characteristics of the command and control based system that had been in place for a long time. Competitive rather than collaborative relationships among divisions and departments were obstacles to meeting new and changing production challenges. Employees experienced work as poorly planned, poorly coordinated, and characterized by considerable chaos and inefficiency. The \"stove pipe\" relationships among manufacturing, R&D, and marketing/sales resulted in failures to make available valuable information, and in impoverished planning. Managers in different functions had much difficulty coming to agreements, and difficulty keeping agreements once they were made. Some senior managers devalued managers below them in the hierarchy; at the same time, the tendency to find people to blame for problems led people to try to protect themselves from risk, and from having to admit mistakes. The tendency to manage quality and other manufacturing problems as if they were moment tomoment crises was a chronic and critical issue for the organization. What strategy did we use to implement cross functional collaboration? The change strategy was a broad collaborative effort between key managers at Maiden Mills and our consulting organization. We operated on several levels simultaneously, and worked to avoid generating strong resistance too early. We also maintained a consistent link between the CEO's social principles and the effort to enhance collaboration at all levels. In out discussions and planning efforts we emphasized the synergy between: Teams and the company's strategic intent and vision Teams and measurable, tangible business results Teams and the capacity to become more agile and responsive to market changes to transform Maiden Mills into what deGeus (1997) has called a \"living organization\" The implementation strategy for creating these changes involved: Loosening the control of senior management over day to day decisions, and gradually turning it over to the people closest to the work. We flouted conventional wisdom, and began building from the middle of the organization rather than starting at the top. From the middle we worked our way both downward to the production floor, and upward to top management. We designed a cross functional teaming structure, and through a training program provided essential teamwork skills. The training program was also designed to repair and strengthen relationships among employees at all levels. Cross functional (and cross level) groups received 80 hours of teamwork and leadership development training. Thus we were able to create a community within which work could be accomplished more effectively. The Team Steering Committee became the engine for organizational renewal. Eventually an Executive Team, a broad based Strategy Council, a divisional Policy and Planning Team, a Manufacturing Operations Team, and a number of Production Support teams were created. At the same time, production operators began to work together toward their own local goals. In addition to training, we made available individual coaching for managers, so that the influence of the change effort could be extended. We created measures of team success measures of productivity, quality, and so on. We also created a bi monthly random sample survey that provided \"soft\" indicators of teamwork and morale. This measure helped us detect emerging problems that could be dealt with before they worsened. One of the internal champions of the project referred to our strategy for successful implementation as \"working under the radar screen.\" We stayed away from the limelight, and concentrated on working with people who could get the job done. The Director of Manufacturing was a strong champion of the effort, and provided us with enough stability and buffer so that the change effort could continue despite the recurrent turbulence in the organization. What about resistance to change? Resistance was part of the normal state of affairs at any given time. We saw resistance as an indicator that change was actually occurring. Senior executives initially resisted the change effort, and even the Steering Committee only reluctantly accepted its assignment. Each organizational level both hoped and feared that change could actually occur. Each level (and each function) showed evidence of a pervasive sense of helplessness; people seemed always to look to the level above to give orders, and for someone else to take responsibility for results. Empowering others meant losing managerial flexibility, control over tasks and results, and loss of control of information that could be damaging. Whenever resistance became apparent, it spoke of a safety and trust issue in t", "venue": "", "year": 2005.0, "author_names": ["Mindy L Gewirtz", "Peter Gumpert", "Yoram Shahar", "Malden Mills"], "n_citations": 0, "n_key_citations": 0, "score": 0}, {"corpus_id": 32438211, "title": "Primary Care at a Crossroads", "abstract": "The term primary care means different things to different people. Many of us have championed primary care because of its theoretical and practical contributions to the health of individuals and populations. Despite the rise of scientific medicine and specialization, the concept of primary care has achieved an important place in the delivery of health services. Over the past century, primary care has developed from the idea of a family doctor who tended to the medical, and at times the emotional and social, needs of his patients to a new and much richer and idealized concept that includes prevention, continuity of care, health maintenance, and death with dignity, among others. The renaissance of primary care that began in the 1970s, however, has begun to wane. Today several organizational, economic, and social forces are presenting new challenges to primary care. How those challenges are addressed will largely determine the future of primary care and primary care's role in addressing the health needs of our population. The attributes of first contact, continuous, and comprehensive care make primary care an excellent entry point to and coordinator of care. These same characteristics, however, also make primary care an ideal gatekeeper for managed care and other systems that wish to control access to and utilization of services. The success of boutique providers who guarantee access, a continuous relationship with a primary care physician, and personalized referral to a specialist in return for a retainer fee (for those who can afford it) demonstrates another aspect of the attractiveness of primary care amidst a rising tide of consumerism and so called market driven medicine. Almost uniquely among health care specialties, primary care providers have been willing, even eager, to include within primary care's responsibilities a variety of functions that are not strictly medical in nature and that go well beyond a provider's practice site. The use of a team of providers with varied expertise is a logical extension of this broadening of the definition of primary care's role. This expansion of responsibility also prompts the question, however, of whether primary care has become too complex, taken on too much, promised too much to too many. Must a primary care provider care for all, be up to date on all of the latest discoveries and treatments and be an expert diagnostician, have the patience to care for persons with chronic illness, the compassion to care for those at the end of life, the sophistication to recognize behavioral and social problems, the communication skills to encourage patient behavior change? Have we raised the bar too high, put too much responsibility on the shoulders of primary care? In response to concerns about the future of primary care, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation invited leaders in primary care and other health sectors to a small meeting to discuss the current and future challenges to primary care and to develop new and innovative ideas about how primary care might meet the needs of our current and future population. Forty five persons attended the meeting (see Appendix for a list of the attendees) The meeting was organized by a team at the University of California, San Francisco, that worked with an advisory committee and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation staff to define the meeting's goals, objectives, and content. Held in early October 2001, in Glen Cove, New York, the goal of The Future of Primary Care meeting was to identify a set of normative ideas or principles to help guide future discussions about the definition and creation of a health care system that will address the needs of our future population. The premise of the meeting was that primary care is at a crossroads; especially as our population and the financing and organization of the health care system change, the future of primary care should not be taken for granted. Rather, primary care must be able to justify its place in a system where, for example, specialist physicians and nurses are increasingly providing principal care and where patients often choose to go to nontraditional settings for their care. An objective of the meeting was to question the current definitions and assumptions associated with primary care and examine whether they are still relevant, either in today's or a redesigned health care system. The Glen Cove meeting was not a consensus conference. No votes were taken, and there were lively discussions and debates about many ideas and issues. The discussions focused on identifying and developing ideas that could describe and help define normative systems of care. The central question was, What principles can be identified for the organization and delivery of care to address the needs of our future population? Rather than focusing on adjusting current financing and workforce policies to today's fragmented and often dysfunctional health care system, the goal was to start a dialogue on how primary care should be delivered. The principles and ideas identified could then be used to construct new primary care systems, with finance and workforce policies created to support the development and use of the new systems. As preparation for the meeting, 15 papers were commissioned to provide background for the meeting's discussions. The papers described the current state of primary care and the components of primary care, and they provided ideas about how primary care might be reconstructed. Revised versions of 4 of these papers are included in this Annals supplement. Primary Care Medicine in Crisis: Toward Reconstruction and Renewal (1) by Gordon Moore and Jonathan Showstack, describes challenges facing primary care and how primary care's strengths can help address those challenges. Defining the Future of Primary Care: What Can We Learn from Patients? (2) by Dana Gelb Safran, discusses the patient's view of and experience with primary care. Chronic Illness Management in Primary Care: What Is the Role of Primary Care? (3) by Arlyss Anderson Rothman and Edward Wagner, describes the role of chronic illness management. Primary Care in a New Era: Disillusion and Dissolution? (4) by Lewis Sandy and Steven Schroeder, suggests that current forces in the health care system will create the dissolution of primary care as a single concept, replaced by alignment of providers by economic niche, not role. The final paper, Primary Care: The Next Renaissance (5) by Jonathan Showstack, Nicole Lurie, Eric Larson, Arlyss Anderson Rothman, and Susan Hassmiller, presents the ideas and suggestions, based in part on discussions at the meeting, about how to address primary care's current dilemmas. These and the other background papers commissioned for the meeting will be available as a book, The Future of Primary Care, to be published by Jossey Bass, an imprint of John Wiley Sons. We also call readers' attention to two closely related editorials in this issue. One (6) describes strategies for effecting change in primary care. The second (7) discusses payment for primary care services. Following the first editorial are the mission statements of the primary care service delivery programs of three large health care organizations. We hope that the papers in this supplement and the accompanying editorials and primary care mission statements stimulate additional thought and discussion about the current conditions and future of primary care.", "venue": "Annals of Internal Medicine", "year": 2003.0, "author_names": ["Jonathan A Showstack", "Arlyss Anderson Rothman", "Susan B Hassmiller"], "n_citations": 13, "n_key_citations": 0, "score": 0}]}

The research questions important for this review are focusing on the current state of ICT education for women in rural Africa, the opportunities to improve on this current state, and the challenges that could influence the quantity of the improvements that could be made. The results showed that the ICT usage and education needed for this is small under the African women. The results also provided a need for ICT to improve the information access for women on different fields. They need education, especially about how to use and maintain different ICTs. But there are different challenges which could be limitations to the opportunities for women and their ICT usage in rural Africa.

Results In total 8 literature results were useful for the literature review according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The idea that ICT is important for women started with the feminism movement. The results say that the education on ICT is not how it should be. Women in Africa have an information need on multiple subjects, for example health. They need to overcome the different challenges, for example the literacy problem and the self esteem problem to ensure that ICTs can be used and will be maintained by women in rural Africa.

Results: Google Scholar produced records for ~95% of the papers cited by Chou et al.

Lean construction is oriented towards the process related parameters of construction associated with improving flow, enhancing productivity, eliminating waste and reducing delays. Meanwhile, sustainable construction aims at reducing the harmful impacts on the environment due to construction activities along with due attention to the economic and social aspects of the project. However, both these paradigms are found to hold certain common objectives in the form of promoting resource efficiency and minimizing waste. This paper reviews the studies published in the domain of lean construction and environmental sustainability by categorizing the links between them within various dimensions of the lean philosophy such as lean principles, lean wastes, lean tools, and other associated lean tenets. The review deciphers the influence of these individual realms of lean construction on some environmental parameters such as resource use, emissions, pollution, and energy use. The review provides insights into important and distinct linkages between lean and the environment and further motivates the expansion of the boundaries of lean construction philosophy into the operation phase of a project's life cycle where its influence is found to be sparse. Hence, the study briefly examines the potential of considering energy waste under the ambit of lean construction philosophy and the prospects of research in this domain.

It provided an open but secured information storage and exchange platform for the multiple stakeholders to achieve the openness, interoperability and decentralization in era of industry 4.0.

To the authors' knowledge, no study provides secure updating and sharing solution for large amounts of healthcare information in communication channels amongst hospitals. Therefore, this study proposes and discusses a novel steganography based blockchain method in the spatial domain as a solution. The novelty of the proposed method is the removal and addition of new particles in the particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm. In addition, hash function can hide secret medical COVID 19 data in hospital databases whilst providing confidentiality with high embedding capacity and high image quality. Moreover, stego images with hash data and blockchain technology are used in updating and sharing medical COVID 19 data between hospitals in the network to improve the level of confidentiality and protect the integrity of medical COVID 19 data in grey scale images, achieve data availability if any connection failure occurs in a single point of the network and eliminate the central point (third party) in the network during transmission. The proposed method is discussed in three stages. Firstly, the pre hiding stage estimates the embedding capacity of each host image. Secondly, the secret COVID 19 data hiding stage uses PSO algorithm and hash function.

We also demonstrate that the properties of the communication network can influence the performance largely, even in the case where only one of the participants in the DLT system has poor network access.", "venue": "2019 International Conference on Networked Systems (NetSys)", "year": 2019.0, "author_names": ["Fabien Geyer", "Holger Kinkelin", "Hendrik Folke Leppelsack", "Stefan Liebald", "Dominik Scholz", "Georg Carle", "Dominic A Schupke"], "n_citations": 3, "n_key_citations": 0, "score": 0}, {"corpus_id": 220258859, "title": "Blockchain Enabled Industrial Internet of Things: Advances, Applications, and Challenges", "abstract": "T revolutionary industry digitization coupled with the proliferation of the Internet of Things causes a paradigm shift for industrial and manufacturing companies, renowned as Smart Industry or the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) This concept, also advertised as Industry 4.0, leverages the power of smart machines fused with real time analytics, cyber physical systems, cloud and cognitive computing to capture and exploit massively produced and communicated data. This aims at promoting multi disciplinary business intelligence and supporting efficient quality control and a traceable supply chain, predictive maintenance, enhanced field services, asset tracking, as well as sustainable green practices. An IIoT ecosystem mainly focuses on effectively controlling the physical world comprising smart devices distributed among the entire industry to collect and securely exchange and analyze massive ambient data. While cloud computing constitutes the fertile soil for handling such issues, it however necessitates high end servers and high speed networks to provision storage related/computation related services. In this regard, a centralized cloud enabled IIoT framework is perceived by IoT services as a black box with impeding factors of resilience, adaptability, fault tolerance, trust, security and privacy, maintenance costs, and asthenic time critical IoT applications' support. Stepping toward coping with these challenges, blockchain represents one of the most suitable candidate technologies able to support a secure and distributed IIoT ecosystem. The blockchain is an amalgamation of cryptography, public key infrastructure, and economic modeling, applied to peer to peer networking and decentralized consensus to achieve distributed database synchronization. Its perks of decentralization, immutability, auditability, and fault tolerance render it more attractive to enclasp the benefits of the decentralized framework in the IIoT environment. Various industry solutions and platforms from Lola, COSMOS, Dajie, Filament, Slock.it, SmartAxiom, BlockVerify, Xage Security, Ubirch, Multichain, ShoCard, Chronicled, Uniquid, Riddle and Code, and Datum are already floated in the market for public, private, and federated blockchains to address privacy, monetization, security, trust, identity and data management issues. From the perspective of blockchain employment across the wide range of IIoT use cases (e.g. in the food industry, cybersecurity, voting, music, real estate, healthcare, insurance, supply chain and logistics, energy and smart grid, apparel, textile and fashion industry) there exist numerous operational and technical exposures to the development and deployment of IIoT related applications outlining significant challenges that stand in the way of achieving absolute IIoT decentralization using blockchain, given the vast diversity of the devices these applications involve. Such technical challenges include but are not limited to risks and regularity issues as well as other associated integrating factors related to processing, storage, communication, and availability, together with the appropriate role assignment that jointly considers issues of security, privacy, trust and scalability in addition to the choice of suitable consensus algorithms. This special issue of IEEE Internet of Things Magazine (IoTM) has solicited high quality manuscripts that: Describe in depth the breadth of real world blockchain based multi disciplinary IIoT deployments that go in line with the above elaborated special issue. Present actual experiences in resolving contextual blockchain related challenges. Develop and share best practices, vision realizations and lessons learned in this integrated environment.

Binomial regression analysis revealed that facial emotion recognition in AD was influenced by disease duration and MMSE, whereas the same was not true for bvFTD. Based on this information, we median split the AD group on disease duration (3 years) or MMSE (24) and compared the facial emotion recognition performance of mild AD, moderate AD, bvFTD patients and controls. Results: Results showed that very mild AD performed consistently at control levels for all emotions. By contrast, mild/moderate AD and bvFTD were impaired compared to controls on most emotions. Interestingly, mild/moderate AD were significantly impaired compared to very mild AD on total score, anger and sadness subscores. Logistic regression analyses corroborated these findings with ~94% of very mild AD being successfully distinguished from bvFTD at presentation, while this distinction was reduced to ~78% for mild/moderate AD. Conclusions: Facial emotion recognition in AD is influenced by disease progression, with very mild AD being virtually intact for emotion performance. Mild/moderate AD and bvFTD show consistent impairment in emotion recognition, with bvFTD being worse. A disease progression of over 3 years or a MMSE lower than 24 should warrant caution to put too much emphasis on emotion recognition performance in the diagnostic distinction of AD and bvFTD.", "venue": "Alzheimer disease and associated disorders", "year": 2015.0, "author_names": ["Maxime Bertoux", "Leonardo Cruz de Souza", "Marie Sarazin", "Aurelie Funkiewiez", "Bruno Dubois", "Michael Hornberger"], "n_citations": 43, "n_key_citations": 3, "score": 0}, {"corpus_id": 24247763, "title": "Differentiating between right lateralised semantic dementia and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia: an examination of clinical characteristics and emotion processing", "abstract": "Background and purpose Right lateralised semantic dementia (right SD) and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) appear clinically similar, despite different patterns of underlying brain changes.

Methods 12 patients with right SD and 19 patients with bvFTD were recruited. Clinical features were documented. All patients were assessed on standardised neuropsychological tests and a facial emotion processing battery. Performance was compared to 20 age matched and education matched controls.

Environmental stimulation is physical, social, and/or sensory stimulation present in the environment that can potentially trigger individuals' emotion or motivate physical reactions. Beyond the personal factors, there is a lack of evidence on how environmental stimulation influences individuals' eating performance at mealtimes. OBJECTIVES This study examined the association between environmental stimulation and eating performance among nursing home residents with dementia. DESIGN This study was a secondary analysis using baseline videos selected from a communication intervention study, where videos were recorded to capture staff resident interactions during care activities for nursing home residents with dementia. Videos were included in this study only if residents demonstrated eating activities at mealtimes. SAMPLE AND SETTING A total of 36 videos were selected (mean length=4min) The sample included 15 residents with dementia (mean age=86) and 19 certified nursing assistants (mean age=36) in 8 nursing homes. METHODS The dependent variable was eating performance as measured by the Level of Eating Independence scale (range: 15 36, with higher scores indicating better eating performance) The independent variables were characteristics of environmental stimulation measured by the Person Environment Apathy Rating Environment subscale (stimulation clarity, stimulation strength, stimulation specificity, interaction involvement, physical accessibility, and environmental feedback) Each characteristic was rated on a 1 4 scale with higher scores indicating more desirable environmental stimulation. Multilevel models were used to examine the association between eating performance and environmental stimulation, adjusting for resident characteristics (i.e. age, gender, dementia stage, function, comorbidity, psychoactive medication use) and nesting effects of residents and staff. RESULTS Resident participants demonstrated moderate levels of eating performance (M=27.08, SD=5.16) Eating performance was significantly lower among older residents, those with more advanced dementia, and higher comorbidity. After controlling for resident characteristics, eating performance was significantly associated with stimulation specificity (how the stimulation is delivered and tailored to the resident) and was not associated with other environmental stimulation characteristics. For each 1 point increase in stimulation specificity, eating performance increased by 8.78 points (95% CI=0.59, 16.97) CONCLUSIONS Environmental stimulation that is personally tailored to a resident' needs and preferences and directly offered to a resident contributed to better eating performance among residents with dementia.

To that extent, numerous non destructive methodologies have been suggested as diagnostic tools in order to effectively monitor and maintain potential outbreaks. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is an appealing method for tree monitoring as it provides with a trivially deployable and efficient detection tool, suitable for large scale forestry applications. Nonetheless, traditional GPR approaches are tuned for surface measurements and they are not compatible with the unique measurement configurations associated with forestry applications. Within that context, we present a novel processing framework, which is capable of addressing features with irregular measurements on closed surfaces. A positioning method is described that exploits a wheel measuring device in order to accurately associate each A Scan with its corresponding coordinates. In addition, a processing pipeline is presented that aims at eliminating the ringing noise due to the layered nature of the trees. Lastly, a reverse time migration is applied to the processed B Scan in order to effectively map the reflectors present within the trunk.

In the current work we evaluate the capabilities of ground penetrating radar (GPR) on locating tree decays in different stages and in different tree types. GPR has been widely applied to smooth surfaces that can be sufficiently approximated as half spaces. In that context, interpretation approaches like hyperbola detection make the assumption that the targets of interest are buried inside a dielectric half space. Nonetheless, the shape of the tree trunks is rather stochastic and the only valid and safe assumption that can be made is that the shape of the tree is a closed curve with arbitrary shape. Due to that, the reflection patterns arising from decays inside the tree deviate from the traditional hyperbolic features that often occur in typical GPR surveys. Under these conditions and without the usage of tomographic approaches a reliable interpretation is difficult to be made. Tomographic approaches are time consuming with high computational demands that often applied to bespoke custom made antenna systems that the end user has no access to. Our work tries to overcome these issues by suggesting a universal \"hyperbola\" fitting scheme that can be applied in any arbitrary given shape. Prior to the \"hyperbola\" fitting, a singular value decomposition (SVD) [2] is applied in an effort to decrease the ringing noise and the unwanted clutter. The validity of our method is tested through numerical and lab experiments. The minimum computational requirements of the proposed method combined with the fact that can be coupled with any commercial antenna, makes our approach commercially appealing for large scale applications.

One of the main factors of tree decay which originally gained public attention is the presence of unknown pathogens carried along by the wind, which can lead to epidemic phenomena and often to a quick death of entire forests. In such an emergency situation, two main approaches can be followed, namely, i) active measures (i.e. the avoidance of any contact between the pathogenic spores and the trees by using bio security measures) and ii) passive measures (i.e. the application of policies for the control and the management of the forestall heritage aimed at identifying the early stage symptoms of the disease) Since the latest approach is based on the monitoring of living trees, invasive methods of health assessment like cutting off branches or incremental coring are increasingly discouraged, and non destructive evaluation proves to be the only option to undertake. The applications of non destructive testing (NDT) techniques in forestry sciences are often self standing and not integrated with one another. This is often due to a lack of knowledge from the NDT users towards the physics and the bio chemical processes which mainly govern the life cycle of trees and plants. Such an issue is emphasized by the evident complexity of the plant and trunk systems themselves. Notwithstanding this, the ground penetrating radar (GPR) technique has proved to be one of the most effective, due to its high versatility, rapidity in collecting data and the provision of reliable results at relatively limited costs. The use of GPR can provide invaluable information about the effective tree trunk assessment and appraisals, tree roots mapping, soil interaction with tree and plants. In addition, the use of simulation can be a supporting tool for the development of a clear understanding of the decay processes in trees. In this study, a demonstration of the GPR potential in the health monitoring of an ancient tree has been given. The main objectives of the research were to provide an effective mapping of the tree roots as well as reliable simulation scenarios representing a variety of possible internal defects in terms of shape and formation. To these purposes, the soil around a 100 years old fir tree, with a trunk circumference of 3.40 m and an average radius of 0.55 m, was investigated. Nine radial scans, 0.30 m spaced each to one another, were carried out all around the tree circumference starting from 0.50 m the outer surface of the bark. A ground coupled multi frequency GPR system equipped with 600 MHz and 1600 MHz central frequency antennas was used for testing purposes. In order to reach the maximum penetration depth of the root system, only the 600 MHz frequency was considered for data processing purposes. After the application of a dedicated signal processing scheme, it was possible to produce a tomographic map of amplitudes covering a swept circle with an outer radius of 3.45 m and an inner radius of 1.05 m up to a maximum depth of 1.56 m. By using a set of specially developed algorithms it was possible to extract signal amplitude information reliably related to the position of the tree roots under the soil. In addition to the above objective, finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations of the electromagnetic field propagation through the cross section of a trunk were carried out. To this purpose, the numerical simulator package gprMax 2D was used. The freeware tool E2GPR aided the design of the gprMax models and their distributed execution on multicore machines. The dimensions and the dielectric properties of the simulated trunk were consistent with the investigated fir tree (actual data collected) Furthermore, a variety of defects representing cavities created due to decay was simulated.

The primary rate of correction is very high, but outcome further down the treatment pathway is less predictable. Several methods of assessing severity at presentation have been reported. Classification later in the course of treatment is more challenging. This systematic review considers the outcome of the Ponseti method in terms of relapse and determines how clubfoot is assessed at presentation, correction, and relapse. PATIENTS AND METHODS A prospectively registered systematic review was carried out according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies that reported idiopathic clubfoot treated by the Ponseti method between 1 January 2012 and 31 May 2017 were included. The data extracted included demographics, Ponseti methodology, assessment methods, and rates of relapse and surgery. RESULTS A total of 84 studies were included (7335 patients, 10 535 clubfeet) The relapse rate varied between 1.9% and 45% The rates of relapse and major surgery (1.4% to 53.3% and minor surgery (0.6% to 48.8% both increased with follow up time. There was high variability in the assessment methods used across timepoints; only 57% of the studies defined relapse. Pirani scoring was the method most often used. CONCLUSION Recurrence and further surgical intervention in idiopathic clubfoot increases with the duration of follow up. The corrected and the relapsed foot are poorly defined, which contributes to variability in outcome. The results suggest that a consensus for a definition of relapse is needed.

The objective of the present systematic review was to determine how reported rates of relapsed deformity and rates of a secondary surgical procedure are influenced by each study's length of follow up. METHODS A comprehensive literature search using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines was performed to identify relevant articles. The definition of relapse, the percentage of patients who relapsed, the percentage of feet that required a surgical procedure, and the mean duration of follow up of each study were extracted. Pearson correlations were performed to determine associations among the following variables: mean follow up duration, percentage of patients who relapsed, percentage of feet that required a joint sparing surgical procedure, and percentage of feet that required a joint invasive surgical procedure. Logarithmic curve fit regressions were used to model the relapse rate, the rate of joint sparing surgical procedures, and the rate of joint invasive surgical procedures as a function of follow up time. RESULTS Forty six studies met the inclusion criteria. Four distinct definitions of relapse were identified. The reported relapse rates varied from 3.7% to 67.3% of patients. The mean duration of follow up was strongly correlated with the relapse rate (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.44; p 0.01) and the percentage of feet that required a joint sparing surgical procedure (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.59; p 0.01) Studies with longer follow up showed significantly larger percentages of relapse and joint sparing surgical procedures than studies with shorter follow up (p 0.05) CONCLUSIONS Relapses have been reported to occur at as late as 10 years of age; however, very few studies follow patients for at least 8 years. Notwithstanding that, the results indicated that the rate of relapse and percentage of feet requiring a joint sparing surgical procedure increased as the duration of follow up increased. Longer term follow up studies are required to accurately predict the ultimate risk of relapsed deformity.

But the problem affecting the long term successful outcome is relapse of the deformity. The major problem is Non compliance with Ponseti brace protocol associated with relapse. Although more comfortable braces have been reported to develop the compliance, they all have the same design and no significant changes have been made to the protocols. After refinement in the Ponseti method and emphasizing the significance of brace to parents, the relapse rate has been noticeably decreased. Objective: To evaluate relapse of Clubfoot after treatment with the Ponseti Method Methodology: A Cross sectional study including patients' information during treatment period was done at outpatient basis in Prime Medical College, Rangpur, Bangladesh and the sample was 200 patients under Ponseti clubfoot treatment over a period of three years from 1 st October 2014 to 30 th September 2017. The 200 patients with idiopathic legs with clubfoot 240 treated initially with the Ponseti technique who had relapse of their clubfoot were identified. Relapse was defined as a return to casting or surgery due to recurrent deformity. Data collected included demographics, treatment and brace adherence. Patients who sustained initial relapse before the age of two years were compared with those who sustained initial relapse after the age of two years. Results: After initial relapse prior to age two, bracing adherence does not affect likelihood of subsequent recurrence. Among the 200 patients with 240 legs with clubfoot after treatment with the Ponseti Method only 15 legs were relapse. Therefore from the study findings we can say that though there is some complications in Ponseti method but the treatment outcome is better than other methods.

However, data from population studies for patients up to 10 years of age are still lacking. This study aimed to survey the relapse and surgery rates in the first 10 years of life in children with congenital clubfoot before and after introduction of the Ponseti method in Taiwan using the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) METHODS We retrieved clubfoot cases and related surgical procedures determined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD 9) 754.51 from the 1999 2016 NHIRD. Foot and ankle surgical procedures coded as ICD 9 754.51 for patients who were older than 6 months of age were regarded as surgical procedures for relapsed or residual deformities. The rate of clubfoot release when the patients were 0.5 to 1 year of age and extensive surgical procedures in the first 10 years of life were assessed among 8 birth year cohorts (1999 to 2006) with a 10 year follow up. RESULTS Among 622 children with idiopathic congenital clubfoot diagnosis, 301 underwent a total of 367 surgical procedures for clubfoot between 6 months and 10 years of age. Disease incidence of 0.32 per 1,000 live births remained stable in the 8 birth year cohorts. After the Ponseti method was introduced in 2002, there was a decrease in the clubfoot release rate in the 0.5 to 1 year age group (25.8% in the 1999 to 2002 birth year cohorts compared with 17.6% in the 2003 to 2006 birth year cohorts) and the rate of extensive surgical procedures (41.5% in the 1999 to 2002 birth year cohorts compared with 31.3% in the 2003 to 2006 birth year cohorts) both determined to be significant at p 0.05 using the chi square test. A significant decreasing trend (p 0.05) was revealed in the rate of clubfoot release in patients who were 0.5 to 1 year of age by polynomial correlation, with an increasing negative slope after a turning point around 2002. The Ponseti method increased the ratio of minor to extensive surgical procedures when a surgical procedure was required. CONCLUSIONS The Ponseti method decreased subsequent extensive surgical procedures for clubfoot, especially in the group that was 0.5 to 1 year of age. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Therapeutic Level III.

The role of surgery is limited. The factors that may affect outcome and their influence are subject of controversy. The aim of the study is to systematically and objectively evaluate the results of Ponseti treatment in our region of Southern Israel and focus on the role of the Achilles tenotomy and compliance to foot orthosis as factors that may influence outcome. The use of Ponseti method was retrospectively studied (level of evidence IV) by searching computerized medical files and clinical photos. The severity of deformity was evaluated by Dimeglio score (D score) at baseline and at last examination. During 2006 2014, 57 children with idiopathic clubfoot (total 90 feet) were enrolled. An Achilles tenotomy was performed in 55/90 (61.1% of the feet. If the D score was 15 or higher there was a 20% increase in the incidence of Achilles tenotomy. The parental compliance had a weak protective effect against relapse. The treatment of idiopathic clubfoot by the Ponseti method was successful and reliable, proving efficiency and universality of the method. A dominant predictor for relapse was not seen. An incidental observation was that extended time in cast may buffer the adverse effects of low compliance rate. Although the initial severity, or compliance to braces are important, there may be other factors that affect the outcome such as, accuracy of the casting technique, time in the cast, access to a dedicated clubfoot clinic, cooperation with nurses and pediatricians, economic status that allows purchase of new generation of braces, cultural perception, and education level of the patient population are some examples.", "venue": "The Journal of foot and ankle surgery official publication of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons", "year": 2020.0, "author_names": ["Eugen Cohen", "Tiberiu Katz", "Uri Rozen", "Tai Friesem", "Eugene Leibovitz"], "n_citations": 1, "n_key_citations": 0, "score": 0}, {"corpus_id": 23824751, "title": "Sixty Years On: Ponseti Method for Clubfoot Treatment Produces High Satisfaction Despite Inherent Tendency to Relapse", "abstract": "Background: Developed at the University of Iowa in 1950, the Ponseti method to manage idiopathic clubfoot deformity was slow to gain wide acceptance until the mid 1990s. There is a paucity of intermediate and long term outcome studies involving this technique, with nearly all such studies coming from a single institution. The purpose of this study is to report the contemporary outcome of patients with clubfoot deformity whose feet were managed with the Ponseti method and who were followed to =5 years old, to provide outcome expectations for parents and for clinicians managing patients with idiopathic clubfoot. Methods: Families of infants seen in our clinic diagnosed with idiopathic clubfoot since July 2006 were prospectively invited to participate in our institutional review board approved study. Patients who received no prior outside treatment and had a minimum follow up to the age of 5 years were included. Demographic, treatment, and outcome data were collected. To provide an array of outcome measures, both the Dallas outcome criteria and the Roye disease specific instrument (DSI) were used. Results: One hundred and one patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean length of follow up (and standard deviation) was 81.1 17.1 months. Initial correction was achieved in all feet. Thirty seven percent of families reported that they were adherent with the bracing protocol; 68% of patients had =1 relapse, and 38% underwent a tendon transfer. With the Dallas criteria, 62% had outcomes rated as good, 38% had outcomes rated as fair, and no patient had an outcome rated as poor. With the Roye DSI, most families were generally very satisfied with the function and appearance of the feet. Conclusions: Satisfactory results at intermediate follow up were achieved using the Ponseti method. However, despite a better understanding of the Ponseti method and the importance of longer post corrective brace use, the need for anterior tibial tendon transfer remains an important adjunct to the Ponseti method.

We hypothesized that the Ponseti method would be effective in treatment of relapsed clubfoot as well. Methods We evaluated 115 idiopathic clubfeet in 79 children presenting with relapse following treatment by the Ponseti method. The mean age was 33.8 months with mean follow up of 24 months. All patients were assessed for various patterns of relapsed deformities. Quantification of deformities was done using the Pirani and Dimeglio scores. All relapsed feet were treated by a repeat Ponseti protocol. Results Non compliance to a foot abduction brace was observed to be the main contributing factor in relapse, in 99 clubfeet (86% Combination of three static deformities (equinus, varus and adduction) together was observed most commonly (38.3% feet) Overall, relapse of equinus deformity was noted most commonly followed by adduction. A painless plantigrade foot was obtained in all 115 feet with a mean of five casts. In all, 71 feet (61.7% underwent percutaneous tenotomy. A total of 15 feet (13% required tibialis anterior tendon transfer. Re relapse rate in group 1 was 21% compared with 12.6% in group 2 and overall 16.5% Conclusion We conclude that the Ponseti method is effective and the preferred initial treatment modality for relapsed clubfeet. Surgical intervention should be reserved for residual deformity only after a fair trial of Ponseti cast treatment. Regular follow up and strict adherence to brace protocol may reduce future relapse rates. Further research is required to identify high risk feet and develop individualized bracing protocol.

Controversies remain as to the implication of initial severity, representing the deformity degree, as well as number of casts needed, representing the treatment process, in predicting relapse. However, no study has been reported to take these 2 parameters into comprehensive consideration for outcome measurement. The purpose of this study is to investigate the correlation between the initial Pirani score and the number of casts required to correct the deformity in our series; to evaluate noncompliance as a risk factor of the deformity recurrence in Ponseti treatment; to test the validity and predictive value of a new proposed parameter, ratio of correction improvement (RCI) which is indicated by the initial Pirani scores divided by the number of casts. Methods: A total of 116 consecutive patients with 172 idiopathic clubfeet managed by Ponseti method were followed prospectively for a minimum of 2 years from the start of brace wearing. RCI value and the other clinical parameters were studied in relation to the risk of relapse by using multivariate logistic regression analysis modeling. Results: A positive correlation between the initial Pirani score and the number of casts required to correct the deformity was found in our series (r=0.67, P<0.01) There were 45 patients (39% with brace noncompliance. The relapse rate was 49% (22/45) The odds ratio of relapse in noncompliant patients was 10 times more that in compliant patients (odds ratio=10.30 and 95% confidence interval, 2.69 39.42; P<0.01) The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that there was significant association between relapse and RCI value. There were 42 patients (36% with RCI value <1, among them, the relapse rate was 57% in 24 patients. The odds ratio of relapse in patients with RCI value <1 was 27 times more likely to relapse than those >1 (odds ratio=26.77 and 95% confidence interval, 5.70 125.72; P<0.01) Conclusions: On the basis of the findings from our study, we propose the RCI to be a new parameter in predicting the risk of relapse in Ponseti method of clubfoot management. Early intervention is recommended to optimize the brace compliance particularly in case with lower RCI value.

Worldwide the Ponseti method is the accepted treatment method for clubfoot. In this method, the treating physician manipulates the foot into a slightly better position and fixates this position with a plaster cast that stays on for a week. After five or six weekly cast changes the position of the foot is corrected. An abduction brace is worn for several years to prevent relapse. The research in this thesis describes how aspects of the Ponseti method are quantified and gives pointers for improvements. Both a literature study and a study with force sensors on the foot suggest that the weekly cast change interval is unnecessary long. A surprising observation was a temperature drop due to water evaporating from the cast, creating an uncomfortably long cold period for the children. Concepts for a dynamic clubfoot brace were developed as an alternative treatment method. Such a brace would apply a constant force on the foot rather than a constant position, making the correction process more efficient and possibly more comfortable. Patents would be able to temporarily remove the brace to allow bathing of their child and the soft materials of the brace makes cuddling a pleasant experience again.", "venue": "", "year": 2018.0, "author_names": ["Robert Bram Giesberts"], "n_citations": 0, "n_key_citations": 0, "score": 0}]}

Past works on RF based tracking either track only a single moving person, use a large number of transceivers surrounding the area to track multiple people, or use additional resources like ultra wideband signals. Furthermore, magnitude based tracking provides an attractive feature that additional receiver antennas can easily be added to the antenna array as needed, without the need for phase synchronization, since the magnitude can be measured independently on the different antennas. In this paper, we then propose a new framework that uses only the magnitude of WiFi signals and expresses it in terms of the angles of arrival of signal paths at the receivers as well as the motion parameters of the virtual arrays emulated by the moving people. We then use a two dimensional MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm to estimate the aforementioned parameters, and further utilize a Particle Filter with a Joint Probabilistic Data Association Filter to track multiple people walking in the area.

Matematika adalah salah satu ilmu pengetahuan yang sangat berguna dalam segala aspek kehidupan. Kemampuan berpikir kreatif matematis sangat diperlukan siswa dalam memahami matematika. Namun kemampuan berpikir kreatif matematis siswa ternyata masih rendah. Hal tersebut disebabkan karena guru lebih sering memberikan siswa hafalan rumus yang rumit, dan juga guru jarang melatih kemampuan berpikir kreatif matematis siswa saat proses pembelajaran. Salah satu alternatif pembelajaran yang dapat meningkatkan kemampuan berpikir kreatif matematis adalah model pembelajaran Reciprocal Teaching. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk (1) mengetahui apakah kemampuan berpikir kreatif matematis siswa yang memperoleh pembelajaran matematika dengan model pembelajaran Reciprocal Teaching lebih baik dari pada siswa yang memperoleh model pembelajaran Problem Based Learning, (2) untuk mengetahui apakah sikap siswa positif terhadap pembelajaran matematika dengan model pembelajaran Reciprocal Teaching. Metode penelitian ini adalah eksperimen. Populasi penelitian ini adalah kelas X SMA Negeri 18 Bandung tahun ajaran 2015 2016, dan sampelnya adalah dua kelas yang dipilih secara acak. Instrumen yang digunakan dalam penelitian berupa tes tipe uraian soal soal kemampuan berpikir kreatif matematis dan skala sikap yang menggunakan model skala Likert yang berisikan pernyataanpernyataan siswa mengenai kegiatan pembelajaran yang dilakukan. Dari analisis data hasil penelitian, diperoleh kesimpulan (1) kemampuan berpikir kreatif matematis siswa yang memperoleh pembelajaran matematika dengan model pembelajaran Reciprocal Teaching lebih baik daripada siswa yang memperoleh model pembelajaran Problem Based Learning (2) siswa bersikap positif terhadap pembelajaran matematika dengan model pembelajaran Reciprocal Teaching. Sehingga model pembelajaran Reciprocal Teaching dapat dijadikan alternatif bagi guru dalam melaksanakan pembelajaran untuk menciptakan suasana belajar yang aktif, efektif dan menyenangkan.
