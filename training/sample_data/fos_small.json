Here, we show that a systematic decrease in left-lateral slip rates along the eastern ~200\u00a0km of the Kunlun fault, from >10\u00a0mm/year to <1\u00a0mm/year, is coincident with high topography in the Anyemaqen Shan and with a broad zone of distributed shear and clockwise vorticity within the Tibetan Plateau. Geomorphic analysis of river longitudinal profiles, coupled with inventories of cosmogenic radionuclides in fluvial sediment, reveal correlated variations in fluvial relief and erosion rate across the Anyemaqen Shan that reflect ongoing differential rock uplift across the range.

We propose to substitute carbon black loaded polyurethane foam, currently used in commercial absorbers, by epoxy foam filled with carbon fibers. The purpose of the present paper is to study the influence of three dispersion methods (spatula, shear mixer and ultrasound probe) and four fiber lengths (1\u00a0mm, 3\u00a0mm, 6\u00a0mm and 12\u00a0mm) on the homogeneity and dielectric properties (permittivity \u03b5 \u2032 and dielectric losses tan \u03b4 ) of achieved composites. Long fibers dispersed with spatula have shown higher dielectric properties than short fibers. However, such a soft dispersion method was revealed to be inefficient to disperse properly the long fibers. Although a homogenous dispersion was obtained with the shear mixer (mechanical dispersion), we noticed an important degradation of the fibers which lead to a decrease of the dielectric properties. Dispersion with ultrasounds appears to be a good compromise between homogeneity and dielectric properties of composites.

However, the extent of this unpredictability has not been studied systematically. We present an extensive empirical study of unpredictability in 16 distributed systems, ranging from simple transport protocols to fault-tolerant, middleware-based enterprise applications, and we show that the inherent unpredictability in the systems examined arises from at most 1% of the remote invocations. In the normal, fault-free operating mode most remote invocations have a predictable end-to-end latency, but the maximum latency follows unpredictable trends and is comparable with the time needed to recover from a fault. The maximum latency is not influenced by the system's workload, cannot be regulated through configuration parameters and is not correlated with the system's resource consumption. The high-latency outliers (up to three orders of magnitude higher than the average latency) have multiple causes and may originate in any component of the system. However, after filtering out 1% of the invocations with the highest recorded response-times, the latency becomes bounded with high statistical confidence (p<0.01). We have verified this result on different operating systems (Linux 2.4, Linux 2.6, Linux-rt, TimeSys), middleware platforms (CORBA and EJB), programming languages (C, C++ and Java), replication styles (active and warm passive) and applications (e-commerce and online gaming).

Here, we combine observational agricultural data (FAOSTAT) with an extreme weather disaster database (EM-DAT) between 1961 and 2018 to evaluate European crop production responses to EWD.

In reality, however, conservation often only starts when species populations are already in a critical state. This may be the result of a policy process in which those actors who see only little or no benefits from conserving species try to delay conservation as long as possible to avoid its cost. A frequent consequence is that populations decline to critical levels so that once conservation policies set in due to legal obligations, political pressure or any other reason, additional conservation measures are required to re-establish the populations. We show that the costs associated with this policy process may be higher than those of a proactive policy. This is somewhat surprising because the costs of maintaining populations at a level at which they are not endangered may occur over a longer period. However, the costs of bringing species populations back to those levels may be so high that they outweigh the costs of the proactive approach.

Both balloon-borne electrochemical ozonesondes and MOZAIC (measurements of ozone, water vapour, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides by in-service Airbus aircraft) provide very valuable data sets for ozone studies in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UTLS). Although MOZAIC's highly accurate UV-photometers are regularly inspected and recalibrated annually, recent analyses cast some doubt on the long-term stability of their ozone analysers. To investigate this further, we perform a 16 yr comparison (1994\u20132009) of UTLS ozone measurements from balloon-borne ozonesondes and MOZAIC. The analysis uses fully three-dimensional trajectories computed from ERA-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-analysis) wind fields to find matches between the two measurement platforms. Although different sensor types (Brewer-Mast and Electrochemical Concentration Cell ozonesondes) were used, most of the 28 launch sites considered show considerable differences of up to 25% compared to MOZAIC in the mid-1990s, followed by a systematic tendency to smaller differences of around 5\u201310% in subsequent years. The reason for the difference before 1998 remains unclear, but observations from both sondes and MOZAIC require further examination to be reliable enough for use in robust long-term trend analyses starting before 1998.

Like family loans and loan guarantees, the IRS almost always will challenge the substance of such transactions. This article examines gift-leaseback and sale-leaseback transactions among family members and offers suggestions to avoid IRS attacks. GIFT-LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS A gift-leaseback of income-producing property to children usually is structured to help donors * Shift high-bracket income to lowbracket children over 13 years of age. * Continue to manage a property and collect rents as the children's guardian. * Deduct rent payments made to themselves as the children's guardian. * Create a source of funds from the rental income to pay for a variety of items for the children, such as education. * Immunize the gift properties from possible estate tax through lifetime transfers. A typical gift-leaseback arrangement structured with these objectives in mind might go like this: Jason Smith purchased a building several years ago for his business at a cost of $487,500. The building's depreciated basis is $437,500 with an annual depreciation deduction of $12,500 (39-year life, no salvage value, straight-line depreciation). Assuming a fair rental value for the building of $20,000 annually, Smith can get a larger deduction by transferring the building to a trust and then leasing it from the trust at the fair rental value ($20,000 rent deduction versus $12,500 depreciation deduction). Smith structures the trust arrangement so the trust period is 12 years; the trust's net income is payable to his daughter, Mary, who is over 13 years of age and whom Smith is not legally obligated to support. The trust instrument requires the trustee to build up a depreciation reserve at the rate of $12,500 per year; the building will go to Smith's son, Albert, when the trust terminates at the end of 12 years. What has Smith accomplished? The $20,000 of rent will be divided between the trust and Smith's daughter. The trust will escrow $12,500 each year as a depreciation reserve and thus will pay no tax on this amount. Mary will receive and pay taxes on the remaining $7,500 each year (a total of $90,000 over the 12-year period) - less than her father would have paid in his higher tax bracket. At the end of 12 years, Smith's son will receive the building with an adjusted basis of $287,500 ($437,500 less depreciation of $12,500 for each of 12 years). Albert also will receive the $150,000 built up as a depreciation reserve (on which no income taxes have been paid). All of these tax benefits are realized while keeping the property in the immediate family. IRS CHALLENGE The IRS generally uses one or more arguments to challenge family gift-leaseback transactions such as the Smith's. * The donor maintains an equity interest in the property. * The transaction lacks a business purpose or defies economic reality. * The trustee is not independent. * The donor fails to transfer a sufficient property interest. If the courts uphold an IRS challenge to Jason Smith's gift-leaseback transaction, Smith would lose the annual rental deduction and thus may have to increase his taxable income by $20,000. Denial of the rental deduction does not automatically lead to Smith's including the trust's income in his because different standards determine eligibility for the deduction. Smith's daughter will either pay tax on the $7,500 the trust distributes to her if the arrangement is upheld, or will treat it as a gift. To ensure Smith's intentions are realized, he obviously should be prepared to counter each of the IRS's expected arguments. Fortunately, except for the business purpose test, the courts have been fairly consistent in showing what will and will not counter each argument. \u2026", "labels": [3], "labels_text": ["Business"]}, {"corpus_id": 85963959, "title": "Environmental and genetic control of crassulacean acid metabolism in two crassulacean species and an F1 hybrid with differing biomass \u03b413C values", "abstract": "Abstract The growth, biomass \u03b413C values, and ability to accumulate titratable acidity at night were compared in eight environmental treatments for Cremnophila linguifolia, Sedum greggii, and their F1 hybrid.

To clarify this, two RRF chimaeras, EcoDI/TteDII and TteDI/EcoDII, were created by domain swaps between the proteins from Escherichia coli and Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis. The ribosome recycling activity of the RRF chimaeras was compared with their wild-type RRFs by using in vivo and in vitro activity assays. Like wild-type TteRRF (T. tengcongensis RRF), the EcoDI/TteDII chimaera is non-functional in E. coli, but both wild-type TteRRF, and EcoDI/TteDII can be activated by coexpression of T. tengcongensis EF-G in E. coli.

On the other hand, relatively little is known about the effect of PSOC in student learning situations--more specifically, achievement goal orientations (AGO) in the university settings. This study examined how different types and degrees of AOO were predictive of PSOC in university classrooms. Responses from 1801 college students recruited from 92 classes were analyzed via multilevel regression models. Results indicated that the mastery-approach and performance-approach goals had positive relations with PSOC. A negative relationship was found between the mastery-avoidance goal and PSOC. ********** Psychological sense of community (PSOC) is important in promoting the well-being of both individuals and communities. Because of its relevance in understanding human behavior embedded in ecological and cultural contexts, PSOC has become one of the core factors in explaining the relationship among individuals, communities, and societies. Past studies of PSOC have been conducted in association with various settings and levels and examined the impact of PSOC in neighborhoods and local communities (e.g., Chavis & Wandersman, 1990; Perkins, Florin, Rich, Wandersman, & Chavis, 1990), community organizations (e.g., Hughey, Speer, & Peterson, 1999), and industrial organizations (e.g., Pretty, Conroy, Dugay, Fowler, & Williams, 1996). These studies have advanced the understanding of communities and other extraindividual phenomena that are known to promote the well-being of individuals. However, little attention has been paid to the impact of PSOC on student learning (e.g., Ames, 1992). Because relatively little is known about how PSOC in the university classroom is created, and how it can be influenced by the students' individual learning goals, it is important to understand the relationship between PSOC and students' learning goals. The role of extraindividual processes, such as the learning environment and classroom communities (e.g., Ames, 1992; Church, Elliot, & Gable, 2001), in their learning experiences can thus be clarified. The main purpose of this study is to examine the differential roles of students' achievement goals on PSOC in the university settings. Psychological Sense of Community PSOC generally refers to \"interdependent with others, a willingness to maintain this interdependence by giving to or doing for others what one expects from them, the feeling that one is part of a larger dependable and stable structure\" (Sarason, 1974, p. 157). PSOC is seen as an intraindividual or a psychological resource that one can obtain from the structures and functions that exist extraindividually. Note that the word community does not appear in the definition, but rather such concepts as interdependence and dependable and stable structure refer to characteristics of the community. PSOC can thus be experienced by not only individuals in relationship to a particular geographical community (e.g., neighborhoods and cities) but also in many types of relational or functional communities (e.g., school settings and work environments). Adapting the above definition, the construct of PSOC was specified and a series of psychological instruments were developed (e.g., Chavis, Hogge, McMillan, & Wandersman, 1986; Perkins et al., 1990). Because communities can be determined either locally or relationally, the boundaries by which a certain community is defined are not of central concern (Dalton, Elias, & Wandersman, 2001). Instead, the psychological experiences of individuals about extraindividual phenomena are most relevant when forming the construct of PSOC. By following Sarason's (1974) formulation, in particular, McMillan & Chavis (1986) developed a 4-factor model of PSOC defined as \"a feeling that members have of belonging, a feeling that members matter to one another and to the group, and a shared faith that members' needs will be met though their commitment to be together\" (p. \u2026", "labels": [7], "labels_text": ["Education"]}, {"corpus_id": 120552883, "title": "The Small Sample Distribution of $n\\omega^2_n$", "abstract": "", "labels": [16], "labels_text": ["Mathematics"]}, {"corpus_id": 97675650, "title": "Photoluminescence Wavelength Control of Fluorene Derivatives through H-bonding and Protonation", "abstract": "A fluorene monomer, which comprised 4-pyridylcyanovinyl groups (FL-CNPy), was synthesized, and the photoluminescence (PL) properties of FL-CNPy combined with various (di)acids were evaluated.

The first is the requirement for an intact functioning thyroid. The evidence for this is that propylthiouracil or severance of the pituitary stalk completely prevents the cycle. What happens instead of the cycle is that the blood alcohol level rises to a lethal level when ethanol is given continuously at a dose of 11 g/kg/day by stomach tube. When excess thyroid hormone is given orally it markedly attenuates the cycle because it interferes with the changes in the level of thyroid hormone during the cycle. The second component is norepinephrine. Catecholamines are markedly elevated at the peaks of the cycle. Both propranolol and phenoxybenzamine, which are beta- and alpha-blockers, prevent the cycle. Also, when catecholamines are fed in excess in the form of ephedrine, the cycle is eliminated. The third element essential to the cycle is the generation of NAD to support the oxidation of alcohol by alcohol dehydrogenase. When complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) of the mitochondrial electron transport chain is inhibited by feeding rotenone, the cycle is totally eliminated and blood alcohol levels remain constant at 200 mg/%. Thus NADH increases and NAD decreases at the peak of the cycle. Without the fluxuation of NAD, ADH activity cannot fluctuate during the cycle and the cycle is prevented. The significance of the BALC in the understanding of alcohol liver disease pathogenesis is that there's a marked difference in the gene expression and liver toxicity when the peaks and troughs of the cycle are compared. The expression of 1000+ genes is either two-fold up or down regulated as determined by microarray analysis. At the peaks there is increased liver pathology, especially inflammatory changes in the liver associated with an increase of iNOS expression. The genes responsive to hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) regulation are increased including the expression of erythropoietin, adrenomedullin and adrenergic receptor alpha 1a and d. The expression of prolyl hydroxylase, which destabilizes HIF1alpha, increases when the BAL drops to low levels during the cycle. The level of oxygen, as measured on the surface of the liver, is decreased at the peaks, compared to control livers. The NADH/NAD ratio is markedly increased and ATP levels are markedly decreased at the BAL peaks. Also, endotoxin in the blood is very high at the peaks and very low at the troughs. When the blood alcohol levels fall during the cycle, there is an increase in ALT, suggesting that reoxygenation from the hypoxic state at the peaks causes an ischemic reperfusion injury-like lesion in the liver.

Owing to short instrumental records, long-term Ningaloo Nino/Nina variability and its impacts on regional climate are less understood. In this study, coral \u03b418O records with bimonthly resolution from two sites along the Western Australian coast are used to investigate the relationship between coral \u03b418O and local SST. Significant correlations exist between coral \u03b418O and Ningaloo SST with 1-month lag, and thus the former is employed to represent Ningaloo Nino/Nina variability during 1854\u20131993. Coral \u03b418O reveals that the Ningaloo Nino/Nina features interdecadal variations, occurring more frequently in the periods of 1860\u20131890 and 1900\u20131970. Correspondingly, the impacts of Ningaloo Nino/Nina on the northwestern Australian (NWA) rainfall exhibited marked interdecadal variations in the 20th century. Significant correlations between Ningaloo Nino/Nina and NWA rainfall occurred from 1900 to 1970, a period when frequent Ningaloo Nino/Nina events were recorded by coral \u03b418O.

An essential prerequisite of FMIPv6 protocol is the advance discovery of candidate access points while the MN is still connected to its Present Access Router, a process which is carried out by the underlying data link layer protocol. The FMIPv6 standard only specifies the seamless handover operation at the network layer and does not take into consideration the impact of the relevant mechanism, such as the advance access point discovery process, on the overall seamless operation in terms of packet losses. At the data-link layer, the MN may repeatedly preform channel scanning operations to discover the in-range candidate APs. During the scan process, a MN is unable to transmit or receive packets leading to service quality degradation. This paper will analyze the implication of the IEEE 802.11 scanning process, that is carried out in advance to the actual initiation of the FMIPv6 handover process as part of the candidate access points discovery process. The impact of such a scan process is assessed on the overall seamlessness of the FMIPv6 protocol and its impact on the user's QoE. In this regard, an iterative channel scanning solution approach would be described, which has been proposed to offset the adverse affects of 802.11 channel scanning process on the overall seamlessness of the FMIPv6 protocol in a legacy 802.11 network, especially during the candidate AP discovery process.

We investigated a drilling site (core Morsleben) and sections from marginal positions. Dolomite/red mudstone beds form rhythmic alternations that were associated with varying monsoon activity. Hence, low K/Al ratios of dolomite beds suggest increased chemical weathering of the crystalline hinterland and therefore increased monsoonal rainfall. High K/Al ratios in red mudstone beds reflect increased physical weathering of the hinterlands during dryer periods. Dolomite layers reflect the lake stage (maximum monsoon) while red mudstones indicate the dry phase (minimum monsoon) of the playa cycle. We distinguished five major types of cyclic facies alternations, representing specific facies zones in the playa system. We have implemented spectrophotometry as a tool for high-resolution cyclostratigraphy. The dense sampling increment (up to 1\u00a0cm) allows for the recognition of all orbital frequencies. Sediment colour profiles reveal striking hierarchical cycles from semi-precession (SP, 99\u00a0kyr) over precession (P, 19.8\u00a0kyr) and obliquity (O, 36\u00a0kyr) to eccentricity (E1-2 109\u00a0kyr; E3, 413\u00a0kyr). A significant \u223c 2\u00a0Myr-signal is attributed to the longer-term eccentricity E4. One monsoonal (precession) cycle includes two carbonate precipitation events. We propose that stratified mudstone and red mudstone are associated with maximum and minimum monsoon during the transition of the solstices in perihelion and aphelion, respectively. The two carbonate precipitation events were most likely created when equinoxes were in perihelion and aphelion, respectively. A sedimentary semi-precession response cycle is a novel finding for the Norian strata. The obliquity signal is attributed to incoming atmospheric moisture from the northeast of the SMK basin. The E4 cycle controls lake-level changes over long times. Apparently, E4 is responsible whether or not a threshold value is crossed. Bundles of 109\u00a0kyr and 413\u00a0kyr in red mudstones suggest a dry system with reduced monsoonal activity. In contrast, humid periods reveal thick layers of dolomite beds, indicating that during those intervals the monsoonal activity was strong enough to prevent the playa system from drying out completely.", "labels": [9, 10], "labels_text": ["Environmental science", "Geography"]}, {"corpus_id": 123224455, "title": "Application of Cyclic Collineations to the Construction of Balanced $L$-Restrictional Prime Powered Lattice Designs", "abstract": "", "labels": [16], "labels_text": ["Mathematics"]}, {"corpus_id": 7228288, "title": "Dietary intake of patients with chronic kidney disease entering the LORD trial: adjusting for underreporting.", "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe study objective was to determine the dietary intake of patients with chronic kidney disease before and after filtering for suspected underreporters and to investigate the impact of underreporting on the interpretation of diet data.\n\n\nDESIGN\nThis was a cross-sectional study.\n\n\nSETTING\nThe study included outpatients from hospitals and clinics in Northern Tasmania, Australia.\n\n\nPATIENTS\nData from 113 patients enrolled in the Lipid Lowering and Onset of Renal Disease trial were used in this study.

Comparisons of computational results with results of a companion towing-tank experiment are presented at Re(L) = 1000. Results of a wind tunnel experiment at Re(L) = 820,000, featuring use of a seven-hole pressure probe, also are presented. It was observed that at the low Reynolds number of the towing tank study, the leeside flow was symmetric at the angles of attack considered. For the same configuration at the higher Reynolds number of the wind tunnel study, the flow was asymmetric under equivalenat conditions for some of the angles of attack studied. The topology of the flow is discussed and conclusions are drawn concerning the growth and stability of the primary vortices.", "labels": [19], "labels_text": ["Physics"]}, {"corpus_id": 58543916, "title": "Genetic Influences on the Amount of Cell Death in the Neural Tube of BXD Mice Exposed to Acute Ethanol at Midgestation", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nFetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) have a strong genetic component although the genes that underlie this are only beginning to be elucidated. In the present study, one of the most common phenotypes of FASD, cell death within the early developing neural tube, was examined across a genetic reference population in a reverse genetics paradigm with the goal of identifying genetic loci that could influence ethanol (EtOH)-induced apoptosis in the early developing neural tube.\n\n\nMETHODS\nBXD recombinant inbred mice as well as the parental strains were used to evaluate genetic differences in EtOH-induced cell death after exposure on embryonic day 9.5. Dams were given either 5.8\u00a0g/kg EtOH or isocaloric maltose-dextrin in 2 doses via intragastric gavage. Embryos were collected 7\u00a0hours after the initial exposure and cell death evaluated via TUNEL staining in the brainstem and forebrain. Genetic loci were evaluated using quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis at GeneNetwork.org.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSignificant strain differences were observed in the levels of EtOH-induced cell death that were due to genetic effects and not confounding variables such as differences in developmental maturity or cell death kinetics. Comparisons between the 2 regions of the developing neural tube showed little genetic correlation with the QTL maps exhibiting no overlap. Significant QTLs were found on murine mid-chromosome 4 and mid-chromosome 14 only in the brainstem. Within these chromosomal loci, a number of interesting candidate genes were identified that could mediate this differential sensitivity including Nfia (nuclear factor I/A) and Otx2 (orthodenticle homeobox 2).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese studies demonstrate that the levels of EtOH-induced cell death occur in strain- and region-dependent manners. Novel QTLs on mouse Chr4 and Chr14 were identified that modulate the differential sensitivity to EtOH-induced apoptosis in the embryonic brainstem. The genes underlying these QTLs could identify novel molecular pathways that are critical in this phenotype.", "labels": [17], "labels_text": ["Medicine"]}, {"corpus_id": 88519577, "title": "Optimisation dans la d\\'etection de communaut\\'es recouvrantes et \\'equilibre de Nash", "abstract": "Community detection in graphs has been the subject of many algorithms.

Under the Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964 the automatic consequence of a finding of unfitness to plead or a special verdict has been that the defendant is made subject to a hospital order with restrictions without limit of time under sections 37 and 41 of the Mental Health Act 1983. The effect of a restriction order is that the patient may be detained indefinitely, and may only be discharged by the Home Secretary or a Mental Health Review Tribunal (MHRT). Hence, a defendant found unfit to plead under the 1964 Act lost his right to be tried and faced potentially indefinite detention in hospital for a crime which he might not have committed.l Two cases highlighted the potential injustices. The first was that of Glenn Pearson, a tnentally handicapped man who was found unfit to plead to an indictment of stealing three light bulbs and five pounds. He was ordered to be detained under a restriction order at a mental handicap hospital. His appeal against his detention was heard by a MHRT after three months. His discharge was ordered by the tribunal because, although mentally handicapped, he was not suffering from mental impairment, which requires abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct.2 Because a tribunal has a duty to discharge a patient who is not suffering from mental disorder within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1983, Glenn Pearson was discharged to his home.3 The second case was that of Valerie Hodgson who is mentally handicapped and lived with her father. One morning she found her father's body. He had been stabbed in the chest. During interviews with the police, she confessed to the murder. She was found unfit to plead and was detained in a secure hospital. Fourteen months later, new evidence emerged, and her nephew was convicted of the murder. The insanity defence lost its attraction after the introduction of the plea of diluinished responsibility to murder,4 and because under the 1964 Act the automtic consequence of a special verdict was the imposition of a hospital order without limit of time.5 Defendants were therefore unlikely to raise the defence.

Methods: The daily QA uses the Rotational Therapy Phantom, Gammex 507 (RTP). The RTP system allows for checking the rotational output, energy, gantry speed, gantry position, MLC\u2010Gantry position synchrony and beam profile constancies. All of these tests are done within one five\u2010minute procedure to check these metrics on the tomotherapy machine. The measurements are done using two ion chambers connected to the TomoElectrometer in rate collection mode. Daily QA data is analyzed using the Rotational Therapy Phantom Software(RTPS) to compare the constancy of these metrics relative to a standard set. The Daily QA protocol runs a dynamic MLC, five\u2010identical\u2010rotation procedure with a period of 40 seconds per rotation. Results: Measurements are taken using the TomoElectrometer with a sample time of 200ms, because the procedure utilizes dynamic MLC and rotational gantry, the procedure allows the software to detect variations in the output rate, energy constancies, gantry speed, position and MLC/Gantry position synchrony at the same rate. This work will present examples of these variations including evidence on gantry position/MLC asynchrony of up to 2 seconds. This corresponds to 18 degrees or 2.55 projections. Conclusions: Using the RTPS for daily QA on tomotherapy system shows that the system can run with up to 2 seconds (18 degrees) asynchrony between the MLC and the gantry position. This 18 degree discrepancy between the plan and the actual delivery could result in significant clinical outcome for a wide range of treatment sites, such as prostate, H&N, Lung and Brain treatments.

Previously, this required quite laborious calculation, which is why many scientists revert to over-simplistic power-law methods. The purpose of this work is to develop user-friendly software for the robust, energy-dependent computation of effective atomic numbers relevant within the context of medical physics, superseding the commonly employed simplistic power law approaches.\n\n\nMETHOD\nVisual Basic was used to develop a GUI allowing the straightforward calculation of effective atomic numbers. Photon interaction cross section matrices are constructed for energies spanning 10\u2009keV to 10\u2009GeV and elements Z\u2009=\u20091-100. Coefficients for composite media are constructed via linear additivity of the fractional constituents and contrasted against the precalculated matrices at each energy, thereby associating an effective atomic number through interpolation of adjacent cross section data. Uncertainties are of the order of 1-2%.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAuto-Z(eff) allows rapid (\u223c0.6\u2009s) calculation of effective atomic numbers for a range of predefined or user-specified media, allowing estimation of radiological properties and comparison of different media (for instance assessment of water equivalence). The accuracy of Auto-Z(eff) has been validated against numerous published theoretical and experimental predictions, demonstrating good agreement. The results also show that commonly employed power-law approaches are inaccurate, even in their intended regime of applicability (i.e., photoelectric regime). Furthermore, comparing the effective atomic numbers of composite materials using power-law approaches even in a relative fashion is shown to be inappropriate.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAuto-Z(eff) facilitates easy computation of effective atomic numbers as a function of energy, as well as average and spectral-weighted means.

The sponge diversity has been analyzed at generic level, using as a proxy the siliceous spicules trapped into the sediment present into the crevices of these bioherms. In total, 41 genera of ancient demosponges were identified. The modern sponge fauna of these coralligenous pillars totals 31 genera, 15 of them shared with the ancient assemblages. The sponge biodiversity during the considered span of time showed critical changes, with remarkably similar trends in both the considered pillars. Tentatively, these changes were attributed to different climatic events that affected the Mediterranean area during the studied time span. The number of genera, 6000\u00a0yr B.P., was low and increased between 5500 and 4000\u00a0yr B.P.

INTRODUCTION Powder X-ray diffraction study Powder X-ray diffraction has routinely been used as a nondestructive fingerprinting technique in laboratory and industry for several decades. Every solid crystalline compound gives its own unique X-ray diffraction pattern consisting of a set of Bragg peaks. The diffraction pattern for a compound can be considered analogous to a fingerprint, or barcode, with the peak positions determined by the unit cell symmetry and lattice parameters. When we collect XRD data, we can use these fingerprints to identify not only what phases are present in our sample but also index the pattern to obtain information about the unit cell size and shape. Powder diffraction patterns of the title compound has been collected with a SIEMENS D 5000 diffractometer using CuK\u03b11 radiation (\u03bb = 1.5406 A). X-ray diffraction (XRD) is an effective method for identifying the phases present in unknown polycrystalline powders. The analysis is performed by comparing the diffraction pattern collected from an unknown sample with the diffraction patterns of known compounds. The automated process is called Search/Match (S/M) analysis. XRD is an important technique in the manufacture of ceramic materials. It provides phase analysis of materials throughout the manufacturing process,. Standard \u03b8/2\u03b8 data were collected using a Rigaku MiniFlex benchtop diffractometer. The experimental patterns were compared with the diffraction scans of pure compounds maintained in the ICDD Powder Diffraction File (PDF).

Optimal management of Society of Fetal Urology (SFU) Grades 3 and 4hydronephrosis with preservation of DRF and indeterminate drainage is less straightforward. We review our experience using serial DR to guide the management of kidneys with high-grade hydronephrosis, emphasizing preservation of DRF.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAfter IRB approval we reviewed the charts of 1398 patients <1-year-old referred for prenatal hydronephrosis. Only patients with SFU Grades 3 and 4 hydronephrosis without ureterectasis were included in the study. Initial evaluation included a baseline DR. Follow-up included DR or ultrasound (US).\n\n\nRESULTS\n115 patients (125 kidneys) were eligible for study inclusion. 27 kidneys underwent early surgery (median 64 days) due to reduced DRF and/or severely impaired drainage. 98 kidneys were initially observed. Of these, 21 underwent delayed surgery (median 487 days) due to worsening drainage. Only 2 patients had an irreversible decrease in DRF of >5%. 77 kidneys demonstrated improved drainage and stable DRF.

In the ovine fetus, increased levels of plasma cortisol at term provide a stimulus to initiate parturition. CRF is central to this event in that it is one of the main modulators of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of physiological increases in fetal plasma cortisol levels on corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) gene expression in the developing ovine brain. Fetal plasma cortisol levels were chronically elevated at 0.70 gestation (100 days) to physiological levels found at 0.90 gestation (130 days; term 145 +/- 2 days) when glucocorticoid-induced maturational changes are known to occur in the HPA axis. The 3' end of the ovine CRF gene encodes 4 putative polyadenylation (poly(A)) signals that may post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression through stability, translation and localization of the mRNA in a temporal and spatial manner. To determine whether CRF mRNA levels or poly(A) site usage are differentially regulated by cortisol in a region-specific manner, we used an RNase protection assay with an antisense CRF RNA probe from the 3' coding and untranslated regions of the gene to quantify changes in mRNA levels in the hypothalamus (Hypo), hippocampal-amygdala complex (H and A), frontal cerebral cortex (FCC) and brainstem. Our novel finding was a 3.5-fold increase in CRF mRNA levels in the medulla oblongata of fetuses from the cortisol group compared to those from the saline group (P = 0.001).

Methods The target gene of FADDdel, designated Fas associated death domain protein(FADD) without N terminal death effective domain(DED), was amplified from human blood lymphocyte by RT PCR and then inserted into the pUC pIC vector. The structure was confirmed by digestion and DNA sequencing. After the transfection of human \u03b2 cell strain(NIT) with pFADDdel, apoptosis of NIT with or without pFADDdel induced by FasL was detected by FACS. The 3 D structure of FADDdel was successfully constructed, analyzed and compared with stereodrawing of the FADD by means of digital molecule mode technology online. Results A 500bp target gene fragment was obtained by RT PCR. Digestion and DNA sequencing showed that the recombinant plasmid pFADDdel was successfully constructed. After transfection, FADDdel high expression cell strain F15 has been built up. pFADDdel prevented the death of F15 induced by sFasL even cultured with IFN \u03b3 and TNF \u03b1.

Rev. B 87, 144301 (2013)] theoretically studied four-wave mixing and parametric amplification in a nonlinear transmission line consisting of capacitively shunted Josephson junctions. By deriving and solving the coupled-mode equations, they have arrived at the conclusion that in a wide frequency range around the pump frequency exponential parametric gain (in which the signal grows exponentially with distance) can be achieved. However, we have found a mathematical error in their derivation of the coupled-mode equations (Equation (A13)), which leads to the wrong expression of the gain factor and invalidates their conclusions on the gain and bandwidth. In this comment, we present the correct expression for the parametric gain. We show that for a transmission line with weak dispersion or positive dispersion ($\\Delta k>0 $), as is the case discussed by Yaakobi et al, while quadratic (power) gain can occur around the pump frequency, exponential gain is impossible. Furthermore, for a transmission line with proper intrinsic or engineered dispersion, exponential gain occurs at frequencies where the phase matching condition is met, while around the pump frequency the gain is still quadratic.", "labels": [19], "labels_text": ["Physics"]}, {"corpus_id": 129613856, "title": "Pleistocene reef development in the southwest Ryukyu Islands, Japan", "abstract": "Abstract Calcareous nannofossil and sedimentological studies of the Pleistocene Ryukyu Group, based on 13 cores and surface outcrops on Irabu-jima and Shimoji-jima, the Ryukyu Islands, southwestern Japan, suggest that these sediments were deposited at 1.5\u20130.3 Ma and unconformably overlie the Pliocene Shimajiri Group. The Ryukyu Group consists mainly of reef complex deposits, which accumulated in a wide range of depositional environments, from shallow reef flat to deep insular shelf. Carbonate lithofacies representing 10 depositional environments were delineated by comparison with the present-day marine sediments and biota around the Ryukyus. Five coral assemblages were defined by species composition and the morphology of fossil forms within the coral limestone, each indicating a particular environment. The Ryukyu Group in the study area is composed of 13 lithologic units. A complete succession of units commences with coral limestone (LST or TST) grading upward into rhodolith and larger foraminiferal limestones (TST) overlain by coral limestone (HST). Episodic subaerial exposure and subordinate karstification commonly occurred after deposition.

Incorporating summer legumes into the fallow period of wheat would allow longer grazing seasons and potential improvements in livestock gain, but may adversely affect soil conditions. This study examined the impacts of additional grazing during summer on soil compaction within paddocks of grazed wheat. Four 1.6 ha paddocks were used to study two systems of producing forage by conservation tillage during 1999 and 2000. Both systems combined winter and spring grazing of wheat with either grazing of an annual legume during summer (SL) or chemical fallow during summer (SCF). Enclosures (n = 2) were established in each paddock to serve as ungrazed controls. Soil compaction was measured by resistance to a cone penetrometer to 300 mm soil depth on three dates (May and December 1999, June 2000), and measures of bulk density and soil moisture were collected. Regression analyses showed a significant relationship between resistance and bulk density across agricultural practices, and separate relationships for grazing treatments. The SL agricultural practice produced greater compaction of soil than SCF below 75 mm depth, with gradual increases over the last two sampling dates. In contrast, grazing generated increases in compaction at all depths on all dates, with the largest increases noted between 50 and 100 mm.

Both groups of anaerobes were confined to the anoxic zone of the hypolimnion. Community biomass was dominated by microaerobic ciliates which had on average 20 times larger cells than anaerobic ciliates. Abundance and biomass of microaerobic ciliates decreased over the summer, while anaerobic ciliates increased. This reflected a spatial shift in the availability of inorganic nutrients and, as a result, of ciliate food from the epi- and metalimnion to the hypolimnion. The low biomass production of anaerobic ciliates was consistent with the low theoretical growth efficiency of anaerobic metabolism. Ciliate species displayed characteristic spatial and seasonal distribution patterns within the water column which were similar in both years investigated.

If, for example, one asks the average citizen whether government is too big or taxes are too high, one will most likely get an affirmative response\u2014 often an emphatically affirmative response. Usually, that same average citizen also wants good roads, superior schools, timely garbage pick-ups, and police and fire protection when needed. One finds a similar schizophrenic mindset if one attempts to evaluate the views of the average American about questions related to civil rights and liberties. Public opinion researchers have consistently found that respondents to surveys overwhelmingly assert that they are strong supporters of freedom of speech and of the press, as long as one is speaking in generalities. Move to specific circumstances, however, and that support will quickly dissipate. In short, the views of the average American citizen about a host of important questions regarding the appropriate role of government, from both a positive and negative perspective, display what can only charitably be called a conspicuous lack of consistency and sophistication. In this context, positive refers to questions germane to what is the proper role of government in establishing and carrying out policies designed to further the common good and the public interest. Negative refers to formalized limitations on governmental power, such as protecting individual citizens from governmental intrusion into areas involving freedom of speech, press, and religion. Social science teachers have a responsibility to address that reality if their students are going to become genuinely informed participants in the political process. Too frequently, discussions of political decision making and the role and responsibilities of the individual citizen in that process take on something of a disconnected approach in the social studies classroom.

At the molecular level, the plant nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs) family has coevolved with rapidly evolving pathogen effectors. While many NLRs utilize variable leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) to detect effectors, some have gained integrated domains (IDs) that may be involved in receptor activation or downstream signaling. The major objectives of this project were to identify NLR genes in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and assess IDs associated with immune signaling (e.g., kinase and transcription factor domains). We identified 2,151 NLR-like genes in wheat, of which 1,298 formed 547 gene clusters. Among the non-toll/interleukin-1 receptor NLR (non-TNL)-like genes, 1,552 encode LRRs, 802 are coiled-coil (CC) domain-encoding (CC-NBS-LRR or CNL) genes, and three encode resistance to powdery mildew 8 (RPW8) domains (RPW8-NBS-LRR or RNL). The expansion of the NLR gene family in wheat is attributable to its origin by recent polyploidy events. Gene clusters were likely formed by tandem duplications, and wheat NLR phylogenetic relationships were similar to those in barley and Aegilops. We also identified wheat NLR-ID fusion proteins as candidates for NLR functional diversification, often as kinase and transcription factor domains. Comparative analyses of the IDs revealed evolutionary conservation of more than 80% amino acid sequence similarity. Homology assessment indicates that these domains originated as functional non-NLR-encoding genes that were incorporated into NLR-encoding genes through duplication events. We also found that many of the NLR-ID genes encode alternative transcripts that include or exclude IDs, a phenomenon that seems to be conserved among species. To verify this, we have analyzed the alternative transcripts that include or exclude an ID of an NLR-ID from another monocotyledon species, rice (Oryza sativa). This indicates that plants employ alternative splicing to regulate IDs, possibly using them as baits, decoys, and functional signaling components. Genomic and expression data support the hypothesis that wheat uses alternative splicing to include and exclude IDs from NLR proteins.", "labels": [2], "labels_text": ["Biology"]}, {"corpus_id": 41675083, "title": "Natural variation in flavonol and anthocyanin metabolism during cold acclimation in Arabidopsis thaliana accessions.", "abstract": "In plants from temperate climates such as Arabidopsis thaliana, low, non-freezing temperatures lead to increased freezing tolerance in a process termed cold acclimation.

Most flavonols and anthocyanins accumulated upon cold exposure, but the extent of accumulation varied strongly among the accessions. This was also true for most of the investigated transcripts. Correlation analyses revealed a high degree of coordination among metabolites and among transcripts, but only little correlation between metabolites and transcripts, indicating an important role of post-transcriptional regulation in flavonoid metabolism. Similarly, levels of many flavonoid biosynthesis genes were correlated with freezing tolerance after cold acclimation, but only the pool sizes of a few flavonols and anthocyanins.

Ground-based measurements of atmospheric trace gas species and criteria pollutants are essential for understanding emissions dynamics across space and time. Gas composition in the lower 50 m of the atmosphere has the greatest direct impacts on human health as well as ecosystem processes; hence data at this level are necessary for addressing carbon-cycle- and public-health-related questions. However, such surface data are generally associated with stationary measurement towers, where spatial representation is limited due to the high cost of establishing and maintaining an extensive network of measurement stations. We describe here a compact mobile laboratory equipped to provide high-precision, high-frequency, continuous, on-road synchronous measurements of CO2, CO, CH4, H2O, NOx, O3, aerosol, meteorological, and geospatial position data. The mobile laboratory has been deployed across the western USA. In addition to describing the vehicle and its capacity, we present data that illustrate the use of the laboratory as a powerful tool for investigating the spatial structure of urban trace gas emissions and criteria pollutants at spatial scales ranging from single streets to whole ecosystem and regional scales. We assess the magnitude of known point sources of CH4 and also identify fugitive urban CH4 emissions. We illustrate how such a mobile laboratory can be used to better understand emissions dynamics and quantify emissions ratios associated with trace gas emissions from wildfire incidents.

Many of the surgical techniques directed at correcting the stigmata associated with this craniofacial deformity (for example, ipsilateral supraorbital rim elevation [vertical dystopia], ipsilateral temporal constriction, C-shaped deformity of the face, and so on) are not long lasting and often result in deficient correction and the need for secondary revision surgery. The authors posit that the cause of this relapse was intrinsic deficiencies of the current surgical techniques. The aim of this study was to determine if correction of unilateral coronal plagiocephaly with a novel hypercorrection surgical technique could prevent the relapse of the characteristics associated with unicoronal plagiocephaly. METHODS The authors performed a retrospective analysis of 40 consecutive patients who underwent surgical repair of unicoronal plagiocephaly at their institution between 1999 and 2009. In all cases, the senior author (S.R.B.) used a hypercorrection technique for surgical reconstruction. Hypercorrection consisted of significant overcorrection of the affected ipsilateral frontal and anterior temporal areas in the sagittal and coronal planes. Demographic, perioperative, and follow-up data were collected for comparison. The postsurgical appearance of the forehead was documented clinically and photographically and then evaluated and scored by 2 independent graders using the expanded Whitaker scoring system. A relapse was defined as a recurrence of preoperative features that required secondary surgical correction. RESULTS The mean age of the patients at the time of the operation was 13 months (range 8-28 months). The mean follow-up duration was 57 months (range 3 months to 9.8 years). The postsurgical hypercorrection appearance persisted on average 6-8 months but gradually dissipated and normalized. No patients exhibited a relapse of unicoronal plagiocephalic characteristics that required surgical correction. In all cases the aesthetic results were excellent. Only 3 patients required reoperation for the management of persistent calvarial bone defects (2 cases) and removal of a symptomatic granuloma (1 case). CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrates that patients who undergo unicoronal plagiocephaly repair with a hypercorrection surgical technique avoid long-term relapse. Our results suggest that the surgical technique used in the correction of unilateral coronal synostosis is strongly associated with the prevention of postsurgical relapse and that the use of this novel method decreases the need for surgical revision.", "labels": [17], "labels_text": ["Medicine"]}, {"corpus_id": 206474586, "title": "Objective measurement of quality of life changes after ACE Malone using the FICQOL survey.", "abstract": "PURPOSE\nThere is little objective data demonstrating improved quality of life after a Malone antegrade continence enema (ACE) despite the dramatic subjective improvements seen by physicians and caretakers.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe utilized the FICQOL survey, a reliable and valid instrument for measuring the impact of fecal incontinence and constipation on quality of life (FICQOL) of caregivers and children with spina bifida.

First, we found that TNF&agr; and IL\u20101&bgr; were elevated in synovial fluid (SF) of RA patients, which resulted in increased expression of E\u2010selectin, ICAM\u20101 and V\u2010CAM\u20101 on blood vessel endothelial cells. To understand whether TNF&agr; and IL\u20101&bgr; in the SF facilitated MAIT cell migration, we analyzed CD161+ TCR&agr;7.2+ MAIT and other CD3+ T cells for differences in migratory capacity. Collectively, our results demonstrate that TNF&agr; and IL\u20101&bgr; in the SF facilitated MAIT cell migration dependent on expression of selectin ligand, sialyl LewisX (sLeX) and CCR6 on MAIT cells. We also showed that MAIT cells in the SF from RA patients equipped upregulated sLeX compared to the peripheral blood of RA patients and healthy persons, which suggest that TNF&agr; and IL\u20101&bgr; mediated expression of E\u2010selectin preferentially attract sLeX mediated MAIT cell migration into the SF of RA patients.", "labels": [17], "labels_text": ["Medicine"]}, {"corpus_id": 25016802, "title": "Novel sensor technologies towards environmental health monitoring in urban environments: a case study in the Niger Delta (Nigeria).", "abstract": "The Niger Delta (Nigeria) is an exemplar of a legacy of environmental pollution. Limited knowledge on spatial and temporal pollutant distributions in the region highlights the need for biomonitoring approaches to study impacts on sentinel organisms. This study evaluated whether infrared (IR) spectroscopy and multivariate analysis could detect alterations in biomolecules in samples in differing exposure scenarios, i.e., spatial and temporal using African catfish (Heterobranchus bidorsalis) or water spinach (Ipomea aquatica). Significant spectral differences between tissues isolated from African catfish based on site or season were observed; in a region where fish appeared not to be present, water spinach was used as a surrogate sentinel organism. Using one-way ANOVA, the spectral categories were significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). The applicability of IR spectroscopy to detect subtle changes in target biological molecules within sentinel organisms along with its low-cost yet high-throughput potential suggests that biospectroscopy permits real-time evaluation of environmental exposure effects.", "labels": [9], "labels_text": ["Environmental science"]}, {"corpus_id": 110799703, "title": "A methodology for modelling energy-related human behaviour: Application to window opening behaviour in residential buildings", "abstract": "An energy simulation of a building is a mathematical representation of its physical behaviour considering all the thermal, lighting, acoustics aspects. However, a simulation cannot precisely replicate a real construction because all the simulations are based on a number of key assumptions that affect the results accuracy. Above all, the real energy performance can be affected by the actual behaviour of the building occupants. Thus, there are great benefits to be derived from improving models that simulate the behaviour of human beings within the context of engineered complex systems. The occupant behaviour related to the building control potentialities is a very complex process that has been studied only in the last years with some focuses related to natural ventilation (window opening behaviour), space heating energy demand (in particular the adjustments in the temperature set-point) and natural light (focusing on window blinds adjustments). In this paper, a methodology is presented to model the user behaviour in the context of real energy use and applied to a case study. The methodology, based on a medium/long-term monitoring, is aimed at shifting towards a probabilistic approach for modelling the human behaviour related to the control of indoor environment. The procedure is applied at models of occupants\u2019 interactions with windows (opening and closing behaviour). Models of occupants\u2019 window opening behaviour were inferred based on measurements and implemented in a simulation program. Simulation results were given as probability distributions of energy consumption and indoor environmental quality depending on user behaviour.", "labels": [8], "labels_text": ["Engineering"]}, {"corpus_id": 143559779, "title": "Application of the Changing-Criterion Design in Special Education", "abstract": "Educator accountability has been a major theme in special education for the past decade. While it is primarily important that an educator evaluate and substantiate the progress of a student over a school year, it is also important that progress be attributable to specific educational procedures. The ability of the educator to make valid statement regarding the efficacy of educational procedures in developing specific skills is central to a diagnostic-prescriptive orientation. The present paper presents a rationale for use of the changing-criterion design in special education. This single-subject research strategy is designed to establish valid causal statements regarding the association between educational treatments and behavior change.

The four projections are: increased enrollment of the nontraditional student, rise of alternative educational institutions, decreased undergraduate vocational preparation and certification accompanied by increased short-term preparation in skills, and diminution of compulsory education. It is becoming increasingly clear that the survival of large portions of higher education is dependent upon our ability to anticipate and deal with the future. Recently, much has been written about collegiate enrollment and its inevitable decline in the 1980s. This paper will examine five emerging directions in higher education, how they relate to enrollment, and their implications for institutional research. Our understanding of enrollment must be a dynamic process; it must take into account potential futures and suggest institutional responses to them.
