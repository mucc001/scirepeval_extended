Separation of these two magnetic components is essential for selecting the precise proxy for climate and dust variation. This paper presents detailed magnetic investigation of eolian sand sediments from the Jinjie section at the east edge of Mu Us Desert to explore the relationship between the magnetic parameters and sedimentary environment. Hysteresis loops and temperature dependence of magnetization (J-T curves) were measured to identify the types of magnetic minerals. Environmental magnetic measurements, such as lowfrequency magnetic susceptibility (chi(lf)), frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility (chi(fd)), susceptibility of anhysteretic remanent magnetization (chi(ARM)), saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM) and \"hard\" isothermal remanent magnetization (HIRM) were carried out to determine the content of magnetic minerals in different types and domains. Magnetic ratio parameters, including percentage of frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility (chi(fd) %) chi(ARM)/SIRM and chi(ARM)/chi(lf), were calculated to estimate the grain-size of magnetic minerals. The \"mean value concept\" in a mono-linear regression of multi-variables was used to separate lithogenic and pedogenic magnetic susceptibility components (chi(0) and chi(pedo)). The results show that magnetic minerals of the Jinjie section are dominated by ferromagnetic minerals with a few antiferromagnetic minerals mixed. Magnetic grain-size is quite fine compared with the adjacent loess deposits, mainly coarse stable single domain (SSD) and superparamagnetic (SP) particles. The equivalent magnetic grain-size is 0. 1 similar to 1 mu m with more fine/ultrafine particles appearing in paleosol layers.

The proportion of chi(0) and Zpedo occupied in the mass magnetic susceptibility is widely fluctuant in the section, thus paleoenvironmental significance of magnetic susceptibility is complicated, and great attention should be paid when magnetic susceptibility is used as a paleoprecipitation indicator. The ratios of magnetic parameters, i. e. chi(pedo)/chi(0), chi(fd)/HIRM, chi(fd) % and chi(ARM)/SIRM, possess significant linear or logarithmic/exponential correlation between each other. All these ratios can reduce or refrain the effect from lithogenic magnetic signals, and thus can accurately indicate pedogenesis intensity and precipitation. We consider that HIRM mainly reflects detrital hematite content, which is derived from the dust source region.

This paper describes a simple, inexpensive instrument that is used to measure these streambed parameters under the condition of a stream disconnected from groundwater. Our method includes a seepage cylinder for simulation of river water depth. The proposed method was applied to estimate the vertical hydraulic conductivity of a streambed and the changes in vertical seepage rate from stream to groundwater with varied stream water depth in the Manasi River of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. The vertical hydraulic conductivities of the streambed determined from 12 sites along the Manasi River vary from 1.01 to 29.m/day where the stream disconnects from the groundwater. The experimental results suggest that there are two kinds of relations between the vertical seepage rate and the simulated stream water depth. One is a linear relation between the two variables with low Reynolds numbers (less than 10); the other is a nonlinear relation (exponential relation) between the two variables with larger Reynolds numbers (greater than 10). This second relationship is quite different from the traditional model that usually calculates the vertical seepage rate from stream to groundwater under the condition of disconnection using a linear relation (Darcy's Law). Our results suggest that a linear relation can only be used for a limited range of river water depth.

Most recent routing protocols tend to find the minimum energy cost path to lower energy usage for all routing paths, thus, they may lead to some of the nodes deplete their energy quickly. To maximize the network survivability by using equal energy among as many nodes as possible , this paper presents a novel load balancing multipath routing algorithm . In the paper, the sensor networks are constructed into a layered network. Based on the layered network, we propose a load balanced algorithm for constructing multiple routing paths to transmit data.

The unstretched laminar burning velocity, adiabatic flame temperature, and radical mole fractions of H, OH and NO are obtained at various equivalence ratios and hydrogen fractions. The results show that the unstretched laminar burning velocity is increased with the increase of hydrogen fraction. Methane-dominated combustion is presented when hydrogen fraction is less than 40%, where laminar burning velocity is slightly increased with the increase of hydrogen addition. When hydrogen fraction is larger than 40%, laminar burning velocity is exponentially increased with the increase of hydrogen fraction. A strong correlation exists between burning velocity and maximum radical concentration of H\u00a0+\u00a0OH radicals in the reaction zone of premixed flames. High burning velocity corresponds to high radical concentration in the reaction zone. With the increase of hydrogen fraction, the overall activation energy of methane\u2013hydrogen mixture is decreased, and the inner layer temperature and Zeldovich number are also decreased. All these factors contribute to the enhancement of combustion as hydrogen is added. The curve of NO versus equivalence ratio shows two peaks, where they occur at the stoichiometric mixture due to Zeldovich thermal-NO mechanism and at the rich mixture with equivalence ratio of 1.3 due to the Fenimore prompt-NO mechanism.

A specific DNAzyme for Pb(2+) is immobilized onto an Au electrode surface via a thiol-Au interaction. The DNAzyme hybridizes to a specially designed complementary substrate strand that has an overhang, which in turn hybridizes to the DNA-Au bio-bar code (short oligonucleotides attached to 13 nm gold nanoparticles). A redox mediator, Ru(NH3)6(3+), which can bind to the anionic phosphate of DNA through electrostatic interactions, serves as the electrochemical signal transducer. Upon binding of Pb(2+) to the DNAzyme, the DNAzyme catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of the substrate, resulting in the removal of the substrate strand along with the DNA bio-bar code and the bound Ru(NH3)6(3+) from the Au electrode surface. The release of Ru(NH3)6(3+) results in lower electrochemical signal of Ru(NH3)6(3+) confined on the electrode surface. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) signals of Ru(NH3)6(3+) provides quantitative measures of the concentrations of Pb(2+), with a linear calibration ranging from 5 nM to 0.1 microM.

Then, the obtained pixelwise probability maps are optimized with the ERW algorithm that encodes the spatial information of the hyperspectral image in a weighted graph. Specifically, the class of a test pixel is determined based on three factors, i.e., the pixelwise statistics information learned by a SVM classifier, the spatial correlation among adjacent pixels modeled by the weights of graph edges, and the connectedness between the training and test samples modeled by random walkers. Since the three factors are all well considered in the ERW-based global optimization framework, the proposed method shows very good classification performances for three widely used real hyperspectral data sets even when the number of training samples is relatively small.", "score": 0}, {"corpus_id": 26193459, "title": "Image-based seat belt detection", "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method for the detection of seat belt in a monitoring image which contains the full scene information of the moving car.

A double mesh system for radiation simulation is used to reduce the amount of calculation and storage, meanwhile a thermal response factor method is introduced to calculate the transient heat conduction process. By taking advantage of the thermal response factor method, two kinds of simplified coupling methods are proposed. To validate the simulation system, a filed measurement was carried out and the simulation results are in compliance with the experiment. The simulation results show that the error caused by simplification is acceptable in most conditions, and a lot of coupling calculation amount could be saved.", "score": 0}, {"corpus_id": 121446636, "title": "Study on the distortion prediction of focal plate", "abstract": "The focal plate is one of the most important components of the LAMOST, whose shape precision to be centripetal and spherical structure of multi-hole.

The SMEROM integrates statistical water quality models, multi-objective reservoir operations, and a self-adaptive GA within a general framework. Among them, the statistical water quality models of the Xiangxi River are formulated to deal with the relationships between reservoir operation and water quality, which are embedded in constraints of the SMEROM. The multiple objective functions, including maximizing hydropower generation, minimizing loss of flood control, minimizing rate of flood risk, maximizing the average remaining capacity of flood control and maximizing the benefit of shipping, are considered simultaneously to obtain comprehensive benefit among the environment, society and economy. The weighting method is employed to convert the multiple objectives to a single objective. To solve the complex SMEROM, an improved self-adaptive GA is employed through incorporating simulated binary crossover and self-adaptive mutation. To demonstrate the advantage of the developed SMEROM model, the solutions through ecological reservoir operation are compared with those through the traditional reservoir operation and the practical operation in 2011, in terms of water quality, reservoir operation and objective function values.

Epithelioid trophoblastic tumor is frequently present in the lower uterine segment/cervix (26/58 cases) and can be misdiagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma (6/26). Lung is the most common extrauterine site of ETT (5/11 with uterine ETT and 10/20 without uterine ETT).

The involvement of galectin-3 in the invasiveness of colon cancer cells remains to be determined. We investigated whether galectin-3 was involved in the colon cancer cell migration mediated by certain kinase pathways.MethodsWe studied 2 colon cancer cell lines (DLD-1 and Caco2) and clinical samples. Immunostaining and Western blotting were used to analyze the expression of galectin-3 in vitro and in the clinical samples. Short hairpin RNA and overexpression of galectin-3 were used to study loss- and gain-of-function in a wound-healing assay and a Transwell migration assay, and Western blotting was used to study the Ras\u2013Raf signaling pathway.ResultsGalectin-3 was expressed at lower levels in DLD-1 than in Caco2 cells. The lower galectin-3 level in DLD-1 cells was associated with decreased cell migration, in comparison with that of Caco2 cells. Overexpression of galectin-3 increased the migration rate of DLD-1, while knockdown of galectin-3 decreased the migration. Overexpression of galectin-3 was correlated with increased lamellipodia formation and distal lung localization in a mouse model.

Transplantation of shockwave-treated HUCB mesenchymal progenitor cells enhanced healing of segmental femoral defect in severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) mice.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\nMesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) in the bone marrow are precursors to bone development. It remains uncertain whether MPCs are present in human umbilical cord blood (HUCB) and are capable of differentiating into osteogenic cell lineage. Extending from a model of shockwave (SW) promotion of bone marrow stromal cell differentiation toward osteoprogenitors in rats, we further investigated how physical SW mediated biological responses in regulating osteogenic differentiation of HUCB MPCs.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nHUCB was subjected to SW treatment at different energy flux densities and impulses. Colony-forming units-stroma (CFU-Stroma), osteogenic activities (Cbfa1/Runx2 expression, bone alkaline phosphatase activity, and bone nodule formation), and bone formation by heterologous transplantation into SCID mice were assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFew CD34+ stem cells (1.3%) and stro-1+ cells (1.0%) were present in the freshly prepared mononuclear cells (MNCs) from HUCB. The number of stro-1+ cells, but not CD34+, increased to 72.4% in the adherent cell culture over 6 days. Stro-1+ cells co-expressed CD44 and CD29 markers and grew into CFU-Stroma that matured into bone nodules. We found that the SW treatment (0.16 mJ/mm2 energy flux density, 200 impulses) elicited superoxide production and promoted formation of CFU-Stroma, but not of hematopoietic CFU-Mix. SW also enhanced the production of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, but not of interleukin (IL)-3 or granulocyte monocyte-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Neutralization of TGF-beta1 significantly reduced SW-promoted CFU-Stroma formation. Superoxide scavenging by superoxide dismutase blocked SW enhancement of TGF-beta1 production and formation of CFU-Stroma. Administration of SW-treated HUCB MPCs to SCID mice with femoral segmental defects facilitated dense, bridging callus and gap closure.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nHUCB MPCs subjected to SW treatment is a potential source for stem cells useful in the treatment of orthopedic disorders.

In order to mimic the septic condition, rat embryonic cardiomyoblast-derived H9C2 cells were cultured in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus peptidoglycan G (PepG) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) against UCP2 (siUCP2) was used to suppress UCP2 expression. Reverse transcription quantitative-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), western blot analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), confocal microscopy and flow cytometry (FCM) were used to detect the mRNA levels, protein levels, mitochondrial morphology and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP or \u0394\u03a8m) in qualitative and quantitative analyses, respectively. Indicators of cell damage [lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 in the culture supernatant] and mitochondrial function [ROS, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)] were detected. Sepsis enhanced the mRNA and protein expression of UCP2 in the H9C2 cells, damaged the mitochondrial ultrastructure, increased the forward scatter (FSC)/side scatter (SSC) ratio, increased the CK, LDH, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels, and lead to the dissipation of MMP, as well as the overproduction of ROS; in addition, the induction of sepsis led to a decrease in ATP levels and the deletion of mtDNA. The silencing of UCP2 aggravated H9C2 cell damage and mitochondrial dysfunction.

The aim of our study was to find out if DNA damage could be increased and c-ras oncogene could be activated when human embryo lung cells were treated with chrysotile (CH) and cigarette smoking solution (CSS) separately or simultaneously. Human embryo lung (HEL) cells were treated with different doses of CH and CSS separately or simultaneously, then DNA strand breaks were detected with single-cell gel electrophoresis assay and the expression of p21 was detected by flow cytometry. Factorial analysis was used to evaluate the combined effect of chrysotile and cigarette smoking solution. The results showed that DNA strand breaks could be increased significantly when HEL cells were exposed to CH and CSS separately for 1 hour and increased in a dose-dependent relationship when cells were exposed to CH and CSS simultaneously for 1 hour. The expression of p21 increased significantly when cells were exposed to CH for 24 hours, but there was no significant increase when cells were exposed to CSS for 24 hours. However, there was an additive effect on the expression of p21 when cells were exposed to CH and CSS simultaneously for 24 hours. When cells were exposed to CH and CSS simultaneously three times (24 hours each time), then passaged for 1 month, the expression of p21 increased synergistically.

The underpinning mechanism of such resistance remains obscure especially in relation to autophagic response. This study thus investigated the role of autophagy in the anticancer activity of cisplatin in human esophageal cancer cells with acquired cisplatin resistance. In response to cisplatin treatment, EC109 cells exhibited substantial apoptosis and senescence whereas cisplatin-resistant EC109/CDDP cells exhibited resistance. In this respect, cisplatin increased ERK phosphorylation whose inhibition by MEK inhibitor significantly attenuated the cytotoxic and cytostatic effect of cisplatin. Notably, cisplatin preferentially induces autophagy in EC109/CDDP cells but not in EC109 cells. Moreover, the induction of autophagy was accompanied by the suppression of mTORC1 activity. Abolition of autophagy by pharmacological inhibitors or knockdown of ATG5/7 re-sensitized EC109/CDDP cells. Co-administration of an autophagy inhibitor chloroquine and cisplatin significantly suppressed tumor growth whereas cisplatin monotherapy failed to elicit anticancer activity in nude mice xenografted with EC109/CDDP cells. To conclude, our data implicate autophagic response as a key mechanism of acquired resistance to cisplatin, suggesting that autophagy is a novel target to improve therapy efficiency of cisplatin toward human esophageal cancers with acquired resistance.", "score": 0}, {"corpus_id": 14353723, "title": "Sinomenine Suppresses Osteoclast Formation and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra-Induced Bone Loss by Modulating RANKL Signaling Pathways", "abstract": "Receptor activator of NF-\u03baB ligand (RANKL) is essential for osteoclastogenesis.

In the present study, SIN was found to ameliorate M. tuberculosis H37Ra (Mt)-induced bone loss in rats with a decreased serum level of TRACP5b and RANKL, and an increased level of osteoprotegerin (OPG). In vitro study also showed that SIN could inhibit RANKL-induced osteoclast formation and bone resorption. The osteoclastic specific marker genes induced by RANKL including c-Src, MMP-9, TRACP were inhibited by SIN in a dose dependent manner. Signal transduction studies showed that SIN could obviously reduce the expression of RANK adaptor molecule TRAF6 and down-regulate RANKL-induced NF-\u03baB activation. It decreased the RANKL-induced p38, JNK posphorylation but not ERK1/2 posphorylation. SIN could also reduce RANKL-mediated calcium influx which is associated with TRAF6/c-Src complex. Finally, SIN suppressed RANKL induced AP-1 and NFAT transcription, as well as the gene expression of NFATc1 and AP-1 components (Fra-1, Fra-2, c-Fos).

Addition of WB improved the fermentation quality and nutritive value of RS silage. The pH value, percentage of ammonia N in total N and butyrate content were decreased, and lactate content and in vitro gas production (GP) increased with the increasing levels of WB. Enzyme treatment decreased the neutral detergent fibre, pH, ammonia-N and butyrate, and increased lactate and in vitro GP. There were significant interaction effects on pH, lactate and butyrate content between enzyme and WB. Therefore the silages in T-6 and T-9 showed good quality with lowest pH and highest lactate as well as no any butyrate. Proportion of ammonia N of total N was decreased by 37.9 or 15.5%, and the lactic acid was increased by 67.8 or 5.7%, respectively, when Strawzyme plus 6 or 9% WB was added.

In cement system, calcium ions are the most abundant cations which would have great influence on the performance of polymer superplasticizer.

And the changes in the conformation of PCE before and after adding calcium ions are studied by methods of dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Calcium ions increase the zeta potential of cement particles and make the molecular chains of PCE curlier, which induces the changes in adsorption and dispersion behavior. The adding of calcium ions makes the ion bridging between calcium and PCE to take place and the ion bridging makes the PCE molecules shrink to smaller size. In this paper, it tells that the molecular structure of PCE polymer could be changed based on the conclusion to adapt the cement with different content of calcium.

However, since the circadian rhythms of growth and proliferation of various cancer cells often differ, the question of whether the administration of platinum anticancer drugs at different times of the day exerts significantly different efficacy and adverse effects on oral cancers remains to be elucidated. This study has compared the efficacy and adverse effects of oxaliplatin (L-OHP) administration at different times during a day on oral squamous cell carcinoma in mice and has analyzed cellular circadian rhythms. Methods The mouse model for oral squamous cell carcinoma was established in 75 nude mice, housed in a 12 hour light/12 hour dark cycle environment. The mice were randomly divided into five groups; four experimental groups were intravenously injected with L-OHP at four time points within a 24-hour period (4, 10, 16, and 22 hours after lights on [HALO]). The control group was intravenously injected with the same volume of saline. Treatment efficacy and adverse reactions were compared on the seventh day after the injection, at 22 HALO. The existence of circadian rhythms was determined by cosine analysis. Results Only injections of L-OHP at 16 and 22 HALO significantly prolonged animal survival time. The adverse reactions in mice injected with L-OHP at 16 and 22 HALO were significantly less than those observed in mice administered L-OHP at 4 and 10 HALO. The cosine fitting curve showed that the survival time and adverse reactions exhibited circadian rhythm.

The final infiltrations under the lower rainfall intensities of 85\u00a0mm\u00a0h\u2212\u00a01 were the largest for every slope gradient, but they decreased by 39.3% as the slope gradient increased from 6\u00b0 to 35\u00b0.

The critical slope gradient was about 11\u00b0. The influence of rainfall intensity on runoff was considerably reduced at the higher slope gradients due to increased infiltration. The influence of slope gradient on sediment loss was reduced as rainfall intensity increased, while the effect of rainfall intensity on sediment losses was greater on the gentler slopes than on the steeper slopes.

This, in turn, restricts its whereabouts to a disk-bound area throughout such intervals. In such settings, we seek to determine a sensor cover, a subset of all the nodes that need to be awake, which ensures that the target can be detected during the given epoch. Towards this, we propose sensor-cover selection methodologies, Greedy Uncertain Moving Object coverage sensor set selection (GUMO) and PAttern Based coverage sensor set selection (PAB). GUMO is a heuristic maximizing the coverage gain at each step, while PAB is an approach based on optimal deployment pattern of sensor nodes achieving coverage of the disk area bounding the target's whereabouts.

The main observation of this work is that task conflicts and channel congestion preclude the utilization of the nodes shared by common tracking tasks, which may result in poor Quality of Tracking (QoT) and/or increasing target ambiguity. In order to tackle this problem, we propose a lightweight sensor scheduling policy - Synchronization based Sampling Reduction (SSR), which explicitly prunes the redundant measurements in the conflicting nodes without decreasing QoT, through synchronizing the tracking tasks.

The experimental results from Japan are considered as the grounds of argument for effectiveness of spray cooling, namely when temperature is above 30\u00a0\u00b0C and relative humidity is below 70%, the decrease of 1\u20132\u00a0\u00b0C can be gained after high-pressure spray cooling. By analyzing the weather data of 1840\u00a0h during the Expo, the results show that\uff0cfor typical year and highest temperature typical year, the effective time for spray cooling are predicted to be 173\u2013426\u00a0h. The meteorological monitoring data during the Expo show that the actual effective time for spray cooling are 387\u00a0h. The actual climatic characteristics in 2010 are extremely close to the adopted weather data of highest temperature typical year. Meanwhile, the WBGT index during the Expo is predicted and analyzed in this paper. After applying the spray cooling technology to a residential pavilion in Shanghai, the cooling effect and pressure and flow characteristics of spraying system are demonstrated in this paper.

Even so, cancer cells remain alive in vivo. Thus, making cancer cells sensitive to glucose depletion may potentially provide an effective strategy for cancer intervention. Tumors that obtain sufficient glucose generate a large amount of lactate. Therefore, we proposed that lactate, a tumor microenvironment factor, may allow cancer cells to develop resistance to glucose starvation-induced death. We cultured cancer cells in no-glucose medium and added lactate to the medium. During the experiment, lactate helped cancer cells to escape from glucose starvation-induced cell death, without using lactate as an energy substrate, resulting in activation of Akt through PI3K. Akt activation plays a central role in cell growth through the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Alteration of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway by inhibiting apoptosis induced specific upregulation of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) through translational control. In conclusion, this study showed that lactate rescues cancer cells from glucose starvation-induced cell death through regulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR/Bcl-2 signaling pathway.

By using XML object as the event container to encapsulate any type of the message, we achieve the flexibility of content definition, self-contained data description, and high portability. With attachment XML object, the lively text/multimedia contents from related source applications can be embedded into target XML object. According to the imported relation rules, all the matching and useful messages in target XML objects will be sent to subscribers periodically. The system provides a good solution to event matching, notification, and transmission services on Internet. With the system, the information publishers can easily publish information via a convenient user interface without programming, and end users can subscribe events of interest and obtain accurate and lively contents easily. We take advantages of the content-based publish/subscribe communication model and Push technology to construct the event brokering system. In addition, our system uses the XML Document Storage (XDS) system as the message exchange center to provide effective management for persistent event messages. The XDS is a data management approach based on XML object, and it provides an XML-based protocol for clients to access its services including storing, updating, and searching XML documents.", "score": 0}]}]
